    <h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

    <p>The record of a life like that of Robert Moffat, the South
    African missionary, can never be devoid of interest until all
    appreciation for noble deeds and patient endeavour becomes
    extinct in the heart of man. Till then, our pulses will quicken
    and our enthusiasm kindle as we read of dangers encountered and
    overcome, of the true courage that could undismayed encounter
    the king of beasts roaming on the African plain, and of passing
    the time with savage chiefs, beneath the spears and clubs of
    whose warriors thousands had been slain. Or our sympathy is
    awakened as stories of sickness and suffering, of hunger and
    terrible thirst, of trying disappointments, continued year
    after year, are related. Anon, gratitude causes the tear to
    start to our eye as we witness the love that prompts the effort
    to win the heathen to the Saviour, and see the once benighted
    ones clothed and subdued, learning in mind and heart the truth
    of the Gospel. Gratitude arises that we have men, heroic
    Christian men, who count nothing dear to them, not even their
    lives, that they may win sinners to the love of Jesus
    Christ.</p>

    <p>Such an one was he, whose memoir we present to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>{6}</span>
    our readers, with the earnest desire that his strong faith may
    strengthen ours, that his quiet courage may excite us to
    perseverance in well-doing, and that his deliverance from
    manifold and very real dangers may lead us to place reliance
    upon Him in whom Moffat trusted, and who never forsakes those
    that trust in Him. May we all see, and especially the youth of
    our land, as we read the records of such noble lives, that true
    godliness detracts not from true manhood, but rather that it
    glorifies and ennobles it, until evil is overcome, and the
    wicked are put to silence.</p>

    <p>In writing this brief sketch of the life of the Rev. Dr.
    Moffat, the author has been much indebted to those who have
    trodden the path before him; especially to the two well-known
    works, "Robert and Mary Moffat," by their son John S. Moffat,
    and to Robert Moffat's own book, "Missionary Labours and Scenes
    in South Africa." He also owes his acknowledgments to "The
    Missionary Magazine," "The Chronicle of the London Missionary
    Society," to the Reports of various Missionary Societies, "A
    Life's Labours in South Africa," and to other works from which
    information upon the subject has been gathered. To the two
    first named the author especially refers those of his readers
    who wish for fuller details than are given in this volume.</p>

    <h3>PIONEER MISSIONS IN SOUTH AFRICA.</h3>

    <p>The history of missions in South Africa abounds in
    interesting facts and incidents. Stories of heroism, strange
    adventures, and descriptions of journeyings among savage tribes
    and through countries frequented by beasts of prey, form part
    of its details. Its theme is love to God and love to man, and
    its facts have been called into existence through the efforts
    of noble-minded and true-hearted men and women to bring their
    coloured brethren and sisters to the knowledge of the Saviour,
    Jesus Christ.</p>

    <p>Many names are held in veneration in connection with these
    missions, names of those who, having laboured faithfully upon
    earth, have been called to their reward; among these none
    stands forward with greater prominence than that of Robert
    Moffat.</p>

    <p>A brief glance at the development of the colony at the Cape
    of Good Hope, and at the early efforts made to evangelise the
    native races, may enable the reader
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"
    id="page10"></a>{10}</span> better to understand the work
    carried on by Robert Moffat, and the success achieved; also to
    realise something of the position of affairs when he first
    landed in South Africa.</p>

    <p>Discovered by the Portuguese in 1486, it was not until the
    middle of the seventeenth century that much was done in the way
    of European colonisation. In 1652 the bold and mountainous
    promontory of the Cape was taken possession of by the Dutch,
    and a settlement was founded on the site of the present Cape
    Town. The earliest colonists were chiefly Dutch and German
    farmers; who were joined a little later on by numbers of French
    and Piedmontese Huguenots, driven from their native lands for
    conscience' sake.</p>

    <p>At this early period the whole of what is now designated the
    Colony, was inhabited by Hottentots, a people lighter in colour
    than the Kafirs and Bechwanas, having pale yellow-brown skins,
    symmetrical in form when young, hardy, and having small hands
    and feet. They have nomadic tendencies; and, in their
    uncivilised state, scarcely practise agriculture. Their system
    of government is somewhat patriarchal; and they live in
    "kraals," or villages, consisting of bee-hive shaped huts,
    arranged in circular form. Their ideas of a Deity are extremely
    faint, they possess little in the nature of religious
    ceremonies, but the power of sorcerers among them is great.
    According to the locality occupied, they are known as
    Hottentots, Namaquas, or Corannas.</p>

    <p>As the European colonists increased in numbers, they
    gradually advanced northward and eastward, either driving back
    the natives or subjugating them as slaves to their service. In
    1806 the colony passed into the hands of the English, and,
    after a season of conflict, the Hottentots within the British
    territory <span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"
    id="page11"></a>{11}</span> were emancipated. This act of
    justice took place on 17th July, 1828.</p>

    <p>In the early years of the present century, the natives of
    South Africa comprised&mdash;besides the Hottentots, who
    occupied the southern portion of the country, and were thinly
    scattered, to the north-west, in Great Namaqualand&mdash;the
    Kafirs, who dwelt in the south-east, beyond the Fish River; the
    Basutos, whose kraals were south of the Orange River; the
    Bechwanas and kindred tribes to the north of that river; and
    far away to the north-west, beyond Namaqualand, the Damara
    tribes, of whom but little was known at that time. Besides
    these, there were the Bushmen, a roving people, small in
    stature, and sunk to the lowest depths of barbarism, hunted
    down by the Dutch farmers like wild beasts, who had their hands
    turned against every man, and every man's hand turned against
    them.</p>

    <p>To the Moravians belongs the honour of first seeking to
    bring the natives of South Africa under the influences of
    Christianity. In 1737 George Schmidt, who had been sent forth
    by the small Moravian church of Herrnhut, arrived in Cape
    Colony, and at Genadendal (the Vale of Grace), then known as
    Bavian's Kloof (the Glen of Baboons), established a mission
    station, where he laboured among the despised and oppressed
    Hottentots with much success for seven years. His work excited
    considerable opposition and persecution. He gathered a small
    Christian community and a school; but the Boers, or Dutch
    farmers, becoming jealous of the black population receiving
    education, he was summoned to Holland, and not allowed to
    return.</p>

    <p>Fifty years elapsed before the Brethren were able to resume
    their work; but in 1792, three
    humble<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"
    id="page12"></a>{12}</span> Christian artisans recommenced
    labour at Genadendal. The occupation of the colony by the
    British Government gave security to their mission, and it soon
    grew to be a large settlement, and a centre of light and
    civilisation to the surrounding country.</p>

    <p>In 1799 the London Missionary Society commenced work in Cape
    Colony; at first by four brethren, who were shortly reinforced
    by Dr. J.P. Vanderkemp, a native of Holland, a man of rare
    gifts and dauntless courage. Successively scholar, cavalry
    officer, and physician, he was for some years a sceptic, but
    being converted through the drowning of his wife and child, and
    his own narrow escape from death, he commenced the earnest
    study of the Bible and the Eastern languages, and gained such
    wonderful proficiency in the latter, that it is stated he had a
    fair knowledge of sixteen.</p>

    <p>Vanderkemp chose the Kafir tribes for his field of labour,
    and in 1799 proceeded from Graf Reinet, then the most distant
    colonial town, and that nearest to the Kafirs, to the
    headquarters of that people. Frequently in danger of his life,
    among those who considered the murder of a white man a
    meritorious deed, he worked and endured great hardship and
    privation, that he might make known the truths of the Gospel to
    the ignorant around, until the close of the year 1800, when,
    owing to a rebellion among the farmers, and the general
    unsettled state of the frontier, he was compelled to relinquish
    his mission.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"
    id="page13"></a>{13}</span></p>

    <div class="center">
        <img src="images/0164.jpg" alt="map" width="640" />
    </div>

    <p>Afterwards he laboured among the Hottentots of the colony
    with rare self-devotedness, often in great straits and many
    perils, but with frequent manifestations of the Divine blessing
    upon the work carried on. Finally, the Hottentot mission was
    transferred to Bethelsdorp, where steady progress was made. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"
    id="page14"></a>{14}</span> scholars readily learned to read
    and write, and their facility in acquiring religious knowledge
    was astonishing, considering the peculiar apathy, stupidity,
    and aversion to any exertion, mental or corporeal, which
    characterised the natives. Dr. Vanderkemp died in 1811, after
    breathing out the Christian assurance, "All is well."</p>

    <p>While Dr. Vanderkemp bent his steps towards Kafirland, three
    other missionaries, by name Kitcherer, Kramer, and Edwards,
    proceeded to the Zak River, between four hundred and five
    hundred miles north-east of Cape Town. Here a mission was
    established to the Bushmen, which, although unsuccessful in its
    original intention, became the finger-post to the Namaquas,
    Corannas, Griquas, and Bechwanas, for by means of that mission
    these tribes and their condition became known to the Christian
    world. After moving from their original location to the Orange
    River, at the invitation of a Griqua chief, Berend Berend by
    name, the mission was carried on among the Corannas, Namaquas,
    and Bastards (mixed races), finally removing in 1804 to Griqua
    Town, where it developed into the Griqua Mission, under Messrs.
    Anderson and Kramer, and became a powerful influence for good;
    continuing in existence for many years.</p>

    <p>Mr. Anderson thus describes the condition of the Griquas
    when he first settled in their midst, and for some time
    afterwards:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"They were without the smallest marks of civilisation. If I
    except one woman, they had not one thread of European clothing
    among them; and their wretched appearance and habits were such
    as might have excited in our minds an aversion to them, had we
    not been actuated by principles which led us to pity them, and
    served to strengthen us in pursuing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"
    id="page15"></a>{15}</span> the object of our missionary work;
    they were, in many instances, little above the brutes. It is a
    fact that we were present with them at the hazard of our lives.
    When we went among them they lived in the habit of plundering
    one another; and they saw no moral evil in this, nor in any of
    their actions. Violent deaths were common. Their usual manner
    of living was truly disgusting, and they were void of
    shame."</p>

    <p>By missionary effort these unpromising materials yielded
    such fruit, that, in 1809, the congregation at Griqua Town
    consisted of 800 persons, who resided at or near the station
    during the whole or the greater part of the year. Besides their
    stated congregations the missionaries were surrounded by
    numerous hordes of Corannas and Bushmen, among whom they
    laboured. The land was brought under cultivation, and fields
    waving with corn and barley met the eye where all had been
    desolation and barrenness. In 1810 a threatened attack from a
    marauding horde of Kafirs was averted in answer to prayer. Mr.
    Janz, the only missionary then on the place, with the people,
    set apart a day for special supplication; they sent a pacific
    message and present to the Kafirs, who immediately retired. In
    place of war there was peace, and the blessings of civilisation
    followed the preaching of the Gospel.</p>

    <p>A mission had also been commenced by the London Missionary
    Society in Great Namaqualand, north of the Orange River, on the
    western coast of Africa; a country of which the following
    description was given by an individual who had spent many years
    there: "Sir, you will find plenty of sand and stones, a thinly
    scattered population, always suffering from want of water, on
    plains and hills roasted like a burnt leaf, under the scorching
    rays of a cloudless sun."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"
    id="page16"></a>{16}</span></p>

    <p>The missionaries, after a journey of great difficulty and
    suffering, reached the land of the Namaquas, and halted for a
    time at a place which they named "Silent Hope," and then at
    "Happy Deliverance;" finally they settled at a spot, about one
    hundred miles westward of Africaner's kraal, called Warm Bath.
    Here, for a time, their prospects continued cheering. They were
    instant in season and out of season to advance the temporal and
    spiritual interests of the natives; though labouring in a
    debilitating climate; and in want of the common necessaries of
    life. Their congregation was increased by the desperado Jager,
    afterwards Christian Africaner, a Hottentot outlaw, who, with
    part of his people, occasionally attended to the instructions
    of the missionaries; and they visited the kraal of this robber
    chieftain in return. It was here that he first heard the
    Gospel, and, referring afterwards to his condition at this
    time, he said that he saw "men as trees walking."</p>

    <p>Terrible trials soon came upon these devoted missionaries.
    Abraham Albrecht, one of their number died, and Africaner,
    becoming enraged, threatened an attack upon the station. The
    situation of the missionaries and their wives was most
    distressing. Among a feeble and timid people, with scarcely any
    means of defence, a bare country around, no mountain, glen, or
    cave in which they could take refuge, under a burning sun and
    on a glowing plain, distant two hundred miles from the abodes
    of civilised men, between which and them lay the dreary
    wilderness and the Orange River; such was their position, with
    the human lion in his lair, ready to rouse himself up to deeds
    of rapine and blood.</p>

    <p>For a whole month they were in constant terror, hourly
    expecting the threatened attack. Their souls
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"
    id="page17"></a>{17}</span> revolted at the idea of abandoning
    the people, who were suffering from want, to become a prey to a
    man from whom they could expect no quarter. On one occasion
    they dug a square hole in the ground, about six feet deep, that
    in case of an attack they might escape the musket balls. In
    this they remained for the space of a week, having the tilt
    sail of a waggon thrown over the mouth of the pit to keep off
    the burning rays of an almost vertical sun. Eventually they
    withdrew northward to the base of the Karas mountains, but
    finding it impossible to settle, retired to the Colony.</p>

    <p>Africaner approached the station, and finding it deserted,
    plundered it of whatever articles could be found; one of his
    followers afterwards setting fire to the houses and huts. Thus
    for a season, this mission was brought to a close. It was after
    a time resumed at a place south of the Orange River named
    Pella.</p>

    <p>Thus missions in South Africa had been commenced, stations
    among the Hottentots and others had been formed, good work had
    been done, and the way pioneered. The field was opened and it
    was wide, but as yet the labourers were few.</p>

    <p>At the time when Vanderkemp closed his eyes on this world, a
    lad was working as an apprentice to a Scotch gardener, rising
    in the dense darkness of the cold winter's mornings at four
    o'clock, and warming his knuckles by knocking them against the
    handle of his spade. He was passing through a hard training,
    but this lad was being prepared to take up the work which
    Vanderkemp had so well begun, though in a somewhat different
    sphere, and to repair the loss which had been sustained by the
    missionary cause through his death. The name of this lad was
    Robert Moffat.</p>

    <h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

    <h3>CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.</h3>

    <p>Robert Moffat was born on the 21st of December, 1795. His
    parents dwelt at that time at Ormiston, in East Lothian,
    Scotland. They were pious God-fearing people; the mother though
    holding a stern religious faith, yet possessed a most tender
    loving heart, and very early sought to instil into the minds
    and hearts of her children the love of God and a knowledge of
    the Holy Scriptures.</p>

    <p>Of the early childhood of the future missionary very little
    is stated. In 1797 his father received an appointment in the
    Custom House at Portsoy, and in 1806 the home of the Moffats
    was at Carronshore, on the Firth of Forth. At this time the
    family consisted of four sons and two daughters, besides the
    subject of this memoir.</p>

    <p>A glimpse of the interior of their cottage, during the long
    winter evenings, is given, which shows how the mother by her
    gentle influence may become the means of sowing seed, which
    shall spring up in after years bearing fruit a hundred-fold.
    The lads were gathered by the fireside learning to knit and
    sew, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"
    id="page19"></a>{19}</span> while so engaged their mother, who
    took great interest in the missionary enterprises then carried
    on, read aloud, in such publications as she could obtain, the
    descriptions given of the work and sufferings of the pioneer
    labourers in heathen lands, more especially of the Moravians in
    Greenland and the East Indies.</p>

    <p>Of educational advantages, Robert had but few in his early
    days. One, "Wully Mitchell," as he was popularly called, the
    parish schoolmaster was his first tutor; and "the Shorter
    Catechism," the title-page of which contained the alphabet, his
    first instruction book. His progress was but slow, his hands
    often being made to suffer for the dullness of his brains. A
    boy living in the midst of shipping, his desires were more for
    nautical matters than for Wully's books, and so he ran off to
    sea. The captain of the ship on which he was, became much
    attached to the lad, so with his parent's consent, he made
    several voyages in the coasting trade. Many hairbreadth escapes
    fell to his lot, and at last he quitted the sea, as he states
    "to the no small joy of my parents."</p>

    <p>When about eleven he accompanied his elder brother,
    Alexander, to Mr. Paton's school at Falkirk. This school was
    for writing and book-keeping, but such as chose to pay received
    lessons in astronomy and geography after school hours.
    Alexander was one of these, and Robert was allowed to wait for
    his brother in the large room while the class was being
    conducted. "I felt queer," he tells us "to know what the master
    was doing within the circle, and used to look very attentively
    through any little slip of an opening under an elbow, while I
    eagerly listened to the illustrations given, the master all the
    while never suspecting that I was capable of understanding the
    planetary system. What I could not understand my
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"
    id="page20"></a>{20}</span> brother explained on our way home."
    In this manner he picked up some knowledge of astronomy.</p>

    <p>At this school the lad continued for six months. It was the
    last he ever attended.</p>

    <p>When about fourteen, Robert Moffat was apprenticed to a
    gardener, named John Robertson, a just but hard man, who lived
    at Parkhill, Polmont. The toil was severe and the food scanty.
    Often in the bitter cold of a Scottish winter the lads employed
    were required to commence work at four o'clock in the morning,
    and had to hammer their knuckles against the handles of their
    spades to try and bring some feeling into them. Here he
    remained till the end of 1812.</p>

    <p>While thus engaged, he managed to attend an evening class
    occasionally, and made an attempt at learning Latin and
    mensuration. He also picked up some knowledge of the smith's
    craft, and acquired sufficient skill to play a little on the
    violin. A special craving, which stood him in good stead in
    after life, impelled him to learn something of whatever he came
    in contact with.</p>

    <p>Upon the completion of his apprenticeship, in 1812, he
    obtained a situation at Donibristle, a seat of the Earl of
    Moray at Aberdour. Here, he delighted his fellow-workers of an
    evening by his violin performances, was fond of athletic
    sports, in which he excelled, and became an accomplished
    swimmer, saving the life of one of his companions, who having
    got out of his depth was in imminent danger of drowning.</p>

    <p>In this situation he continued about a twelvemonth, and
    then, being about sixteen, he found employment as
    under-gardener to Mr. Leigh, of High Leigh, in Cheshire. While
    at Donibristle he had been able to frequently visit his
    parents; the time had now come when he must bid them
    adieu.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"
    id="page21"></a>{21}</span></p>

    <p>The parting scene between Robert and his mother has been
    sketched by his own hand and appeared in the Bible Society's
    "Gleanings for the Young." It is described as
    follows:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"When we came within sight of the spot where we were to
    part, perhaps never again to meet in this world, she
    said&mdash;</p>

    <p>"'Now, my Robert, let us stand here for a few minutes, for I
    wish to ask one favour of you before we part, and I know you
    will not refuse to do what your mother asks.'</p>

    <p>"'What is it, mother?' I inquired.</p>

    <p>"'Do promise me first that you will do what I am now going
    to ask, and I shall tell you.'</p>

    <p>"'No, mother, I cannot till you tell me what your wish
    is.'</p>

    <p>"'O Robert, can you think for a moment that I shall ask you,
    my son, to do anything that is not right? Do not I love
    you?'</p>

    <p>"'Yes, mother, I know you do; but I do not like to make
    promises which I may not be able to fulfil.'</p>

    <p>"I kept my eyes fixed on the ground. I was silent, trying to
    resist the rising emotion. She sighed deeply. I lifted my eyes
    and saw the big tears rolling down the cheeks which were wont
    to press mine. I was conquered, and as soon as I could recover
    speech, I said&mdash;</p>

    <p>"'O mother! ask what you will and I shall do it.'</p>

    <p>"'I only ask you whether you will read a chapter in the
    Bible every morning and another every evening?'</p>

    <p>"I interrupted by saying, 'Mother, you know I read my
    Bible.'</p>

    <p>"'I know you do, but you do not read it regularly, or as a
    duty you owe to God, its Author.' And she added: 'Now I shall
    return home with a happy heart,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"
    id="page22"></a>{22}</span> inasmuch as you have promised to
    read the Scriptures daily. O Robert, my son, read much in the
    New Testament. Read much in the Gospels&mdash;the blessed
    Gospels; then you cannot well go astray. If you pray, the Lord
    Himself will teach you.'</p>

    <p>"I parted from my beloved mother, now long gone to that
    mansion about which she loved to speak. I went on my way, and
    ere long found myself among strangers. My charge was an
    important one for a youth, and though possessing a muscular
    frame and a mind full of energy, it required all to keep pace
    with the duty which devolved upon me. I lived at a considerable
    distance from what are called the means of grace, and the
    Sabbaths were not always at my command. I met with none who
    appeared to make religion their chief concern. I mingled, when
    opportunities offered, with the gay and godless in what are
    considered innocent amusements, where I soon became a
    favourite; <i>but I never forgot my promise to my
    mother</i>."</p>

    <p>After several delays, High Leigh was reached on Saturday,
    26th December, 1813, and there the young man found himself
    surrounded by a genial atmosphere. The head gardener took to
    him, and soon left a great deal in his hands. This made his
    work very heavy and responsible; but, although labouring almost
    day and night, he yet managed to devote some time to the study
    of such books as he could obtain. The kindly notice of Mrs.
    Leigh was attracted to him, and she lent him books, and
    encouraged him to studious pursuits.</p>

    <p>In very early years serious impressions had been made upon
    the heart of Robert Moffat. The earnest teachings of his
    minister, combined with his mother's counsels and prayers, left
    recollections which could never be effaced. These impressions
    were now to be deepened, and the good seed that had been sown
    to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"
    id="page23"></a>{23}</span> be quickened. The Wesleyan
    Methodists had commenced a good work at High Leigh, and a pious
    Methodist and his wife induced Moffat to attend some of their
    meetings. He became convinced of his state as a sinner, and
    unhappy, but after a severe and protracted struggle, he found
    pardon, justification, and peace, through faith in Jesus
    Christ, and henceforth his life was devoted to the service of
    his Lord. Energetically he threw himself into the society and
    work of his new friends, but by so doing, lost the goodwill of
    Mr. and Mrs. Leigh, who were grieved that one in whom they took
    so much interest should have become a Methodist. So were these
    good people despised by many in those days.</p>

    <p>At this time Robert's worldly prospects were brightening,
    and a position of honour and comfort seemed opening before him.
    But the anticipations of that day were not to be.</p>

    <p>Apparently unimportant events frequently determine the whole
    course of our lives, and a simple incident was now about to
    change the current of this young man's life, and to convert the
    rising gardener into the God-honoured and much-beloved
    missionary. How this came to pass we now relate:</p>

    <p>While at High Leigh, Robert Moffat had occasion to visit
    Warrington, a town about six miles distant He set off one calm
    summer evening. All nature seemed at rest, and thoughts of God
    and a feeling of admiration for His handiworks took possession
    of the young man's mind. His life was reviewed, and with
    thoughts full of hope he entered the town. Passing over a
    bridge he noticed a placard. It contained the announcement of a
    missionary meeting, over which the Rev. William Roby, of
    Manchester, was to preside. He had never seen such an
    announce<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"
    id="page24"></a>{24}</span> ment before. He read the placard
    over and over again, and, as he did so, the stories told by his
    mother of the Moravian missionaries in Greenland and Labrador,
    which had been forgotten for years, came vividly to mind. From
    that moment, his choice was made; earthly prospects vanished:
    his one thought was, "how to become a missionary?"</p>

    <p>Many difficulties seemed to stand in the way between Robert
    and the accomplishment of his desire, but the same Divine power
    which had implanted the desire, prepared the way for its
    fulfilment. He visited Manchester, shortly after the event just
    related, to be present at a Wesleyan Conference; and while
    there, with much hesitancy and trepidation, ventured to knock
    at the door of Mr. Roby's house and request an interview with
    that gentleman. He was shown into the parlour, and the man whom
    he had been hoping, yet dreaded, to see, quickly made his
    appearance. "He received me with great kindness," said Moffat,
    "listened to my simple tale, took me by the hand, and told me
    to be of good courage."</p>

    <p>The result of this interview was a promise on Mr. Roby's
    part to write to the Directors of the London Missionary Society
    concerning him, and to communicate their wishes to him as soon
    as they were received. In the meantime Robert returned to his
    ordinary occupation.</p>

    <p>After waiting a few weeks a summons came from Mr. Roby for
    Moffat to visit Manchester again; and, with the view of his
    studying under the care and instruction of that reverend
    gentleman, it was arranged that he should accept a situation in
    a nursery garden belonging to Mr. Smith, at Dukinfield, that
    place being near at hand. Moffat continued here about a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"
    id="page25"></a>{25}</span> year, visiting Mr. Roby once or
    twice each week. Mr. and Mrs. Smith were a pious and worthy
    couple, and their house was a house of call for ministers. They
    were always ready for every good work whether at home or
    abroad.</p>

    <p>"In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy
    paths," is one of the maxims of Holy Writ that should be
    engraven upon the heart and mind of every youth and maiden.
    Robert Moffat's desire was for the glory of God and the
    extension of the Redeemer's kingdom, and God was not only
    opening the way for His servant, but was preparing a faithful
    and devoted helpmate for him in his various spheres of labour
    through life.</p>

    <p>Robert's employer had an only daughter, named Mary,
    beautiful of countenance, but more beautiful in heart. She had
    been educated at the Moravian school at Fairfield, and was
    distinguished for fervent piety and deep sympathy with the
    missionary cause. The two young folks were thrown together,
    mutual esteem deepened into love, and the maiden, possessed
    with so large a missionary spirit, was prepared to share the
    lot of the young herald of the Cross. For a time, however, it
    was ordained that Robert should pursue his course alone.</p>

    <p>After being at Dukinfield nearly a year, the Directors
    resolved to accept the services of Robert Moffat. He left Mr.
    Smith's employment and removed to Manchester, so that he might
    be close to Mr. Roby, to receive such superintendence as was
    possible in his studies. This period extended to but a few
    months, so that of college training and opportunities Robert
    had little experience.</p>

    <p>The time rapidly drew near for his departure abroad. A
    hurried visit was paid to the parents whom he never
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"
    id="page26"></a>{26}</span> expected to see again, and then he
    awaited his call to the mission field.</p>

    <p>On the 13th of September, 1816, after bidding farewell to
    Mr. Roby, whose "kindness, like that of a father," wrote
    Moffat, "will not be easily obliterated from my mind," he
    started for London. While in the Metropolis he visited the
    Museum at the Rooms of the London Missionary Society, and the
    following extract from a letter to his parents, in connection
    with this visit, shows the spirit which actuated the youthful
    missionary at this time:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I spent some time in viewing the Museum, which contains a
    great number of curiosities from China, Africa, the South Seas,
    and the West Indies. It would be foolish for me to give you a
    description. Suffice it to say that the sight is truly awful,
    the appearance of the wild beasts is very terrific, but I am
    unable to describe the sensations of my mind when gazing on the
    objects of Pagan worship. Alas! how fallen are my
    fellow-creatures, bowing down to forms enough to frighten a
    Roman soldier, enough to shake the hardest heart. Oh that I had
    a thousand lives, and a thousand bodies; all of them should be
    devoted to no other employment but to preach Christ to these
    degraded, despised, yet beloved mortals."</p>

    <p>With such enthusiasm he prepared to enter upon the work that
    lay before him.</p>

    III.</h2>

    <h3>DEPARTURE FOR THE CAPE.</h3>

    <p>The valedictory service was held at Surrey Chapel on the
    30th of September. Nine missionaries were set apart; four for
    the South Seas, one of whom was John Williams, the martyr of
    Erromanga, and five for South Africa. At first it had been
    intended that Robert Moffat should accompany John Williams, but
    this was subsequently altered.</p>

    <p>The missionaries for Africa embarked at Gravesend on the
    18th of October in the <i>Alacrity</i>, and after a prosperous
    voyage reached Cape Town on the 13th of January, 1817.</p>

    <p>Two of the party were appointed to stations within the
    colony; Moffat and Kitchingman were destined for Namaqualand.
    Before they could proceed on their journey, however, permission
    had to be obtained from the Government, and this was at first
    refused.</p>

    <p>While detained in the colony, Moffat lodged with a Dutch
    farmer, at a village thirty-six miles from Cape Town, named
    Stellenbosch. Here he learnt Dutch, an acquisition of great
    advantage to him in after life, as it enabled him to preach to
    the Boers, and to as <span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"
    id="page28"></a>{28}</span> many of their native servants as
    understood that language. He also accompanied the Rev. George
    Thorn, of the Dutch Reformed Church, on an evangelistic tour.
    It occupied six weeks, during which time they rode a distance
    of about seven hundred miles.</p>

    <p>After a further sojourn at Stellenbosch, Moffat visited Cape
    Town, and busied himself in gaining such practical knowledge as
    came within his reach. He also visited the military hospital
    there. Many of the soldiers were Scotch, and he had a warm
    heart for soldiers, his brother Alexander having gone to India
    in the ranks some years before.</p>

    <p>At last the requisite permission came, and Moffat and
    Kitchingman prepared for their journey. Waggons were bought,
    oxen hired, leave taken of friends, and on the 22nd of
    September, 1817, Mr. and Mrs. Kitchingman, Robert Moffat, and a
    missionary named Ebner, who, for a time, had been with
    Africaner, and who had come to Cape Town for supplies, set out
    on their way to Namaqualand.</p>

    <p>The history of the Namaqualand Mission has been sketched in
    outline in our introductory chapter. Africaner, although an
    outlaw and a terror to the farmers of the colony, had a respect
    for the English. He visited the missionaries on one occasion,
    prior to their removal to Warm Bath, and said, "I love the
    English, for I have always heard that they are the friends of
    the poor black man." He also sent his children to them for
    instruction; yet subsequent events, as we have seen, enraged
    him, and led him to destroy the mission station at Warm
    Bath.</p>

    <p>The Rev. J. Campbell, in his first visit to Africa,
    1812-1814, crossed the interior of the continent to
    Namaqualand. During his journey, he found in every
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"
    id="page29"></a>{29}</span> village through which he passed the
    terror of Africaner's name; and he afterwards said "that he and
    his retinue never were so afraid in their lives." From Pella,
    where the mission station then was, Mr. Campbell wrote a
    conciliatory letter to Africaner, in consequence of which that
    chieftain agreed to receive a missionary at his kraal. Mr.
    Ebner had been sent from Pella, and had been labouring for a
    short time previous to his visit to the Cape in 1817. Good had
    been accomplished, Africaner and his two brothers, David and
    Jacobus, had been baptised, but then the situation of the
    missionary became extremely trying, he lost influence with the
    people, and his property, and even his life, were in
    danger.</p>

    <p>Soon after leaving Cape Town, Mr. Ebner parted company with
    the Kitchingmans and Moffat, and they pursued their way alone.
    The details of the journey illustrate the difficulties of
    travelling in South Africa in those days. "In perils oft,"
    aptly expresses the condition of the missionary in his
    wanderings, as he travelled mile after mile, often over dreary
    wastes of burning sand, famished with hunger, parched with
    thirst, with the howl of the hyena and the roar of the lion
    disturbing his slumbers at night, and with Bushmen, more savage
    than either, hovering near, ever ready to attack the weak and
    defenceless.</p>

    <p>The farmers, from whom the travellers received hospitality
    as they passed the boundaries of the colony, were very
    sceptical as to the conversion of Africaner, and gloomy indeed
    were their predictions as to the fate of the youthful
    missionary now venturing into the power of the outlaw chief.
    One said Africaner would set him up for his boys to shoot at,
    another that he would strip off his skin to make a drum with,
    and a third predicted he would make a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"
    id="page30"></a>{30}</span> drinking-cup of his skull. A kind
    motherly dame said, as she wiped the tear from her eye and bade
    him farewell, "Had you been an old man it would have been
    nothing, for you would soon have died, whether or no; but you
    are young, and going to become a prey to that monster."</p>

    <p>On one occasion Moffat halted at a farm belonging to a Boer,
    a man of wealth and importance, who had many slaves. Hearing
    that he was a missionary, the farmer gave him a hearty welcome,
    and proposed in the evening that he should give them a service.
    To this he readily assented, and supper being ended, a
    clearance was made, the big Bible and the psalm-books were
    brought out, and the family was seated. Moffat inquired for the
    servants, "May none of your servants come in?" said he.</p>

    <p>"Servants! what do you mean?"</p>

    <p>"I mean the Hottentots, of whom I see so many on your
    farm."</p>

    <p>"Hottentots!" roared the man, "are you come to preach to
    Hottentots? Go to the mountains and preach to the baboons; or,
    if you like, I'll fetch my dogs, and you may preach to
    them."</p>

    <p>The missionary said no more but commenced the service. He
    had intended to challenge the "neglect of so great salvation,"
    but with ready wit seizing upon the theme suggested by his
    rough entertainer, he read the story of the Syrophenician
    woman, and took for his text the words, "Truth, Lord, yet the
    dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table."
    He had not proceeded far in his discourse when the farmer
    stopped him, saying, "Will Mynherr sit down and wait a little,
    he shall have the Hottentots."</p>

    <p>He was as good as his word, the barn was crowded, the sermon
    was preached, and the
    astonished<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"
    id="page31"></a>{31}</span> Hottentots dispersed. "Who," said
    the farmer, "hardened your hammer to deal my head such a blow?
    I'll never object to the preaching of the Gospel to Hottentots
    again."</p>

    <p>After a toilsome march, during which Mr. Kitchingman and
    Moffat took it in turn to drive the cattle, losing some through
    the hyenas by the way, they reached Bysondermeid, to which
    station Mr. and Mrs. Kitchingman had been appointed. There
    Robert stayed one month, receiving much useful information from
    Mr. Schmelen, the missionary whom Mr. Kitchingman had come to
    replace, he having been ordered to Great Namaqualand, where he
    had laboured before.</p>

    <p>At length, his oxen being rested, Robert Moffat bade adieu
    to Mr. and Mrs. Kitchingman, whose friendship he much valued,
    and with a guide and drivers for the oxen started onward. Their
    way led through a comparatively trackless desert, and they
    travelled nearly the whole night through deep sand. Those were
    not the days of railway trains, and travelling had to be
    undertaken in cumbrous, springless bullock-waggons, several
    spare oxen being taken to provide for losses and casualties.
    Towards morning the oxen were so exhausted that they began to
    lie down in the yoke from fatigue, compelling a halt before
    water had been reached. The journey was resumed the next day,
    but still no water could be found.</p>

    <p>As it appeared probable that if they continued in the same
    direction, they would perish through thirst, they altered their
    course to the northward, but the experiences were as bad as
    before. At night they lay down exhausted and suffering
    extremely from thirst, and the next morning rose at an early
    hour to find the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"
    id="page32"></a>{32}</span> oxen incapable of moving the waggon
    a step farther. Taking them and a spade to a neighbouring
    mountain, a large hole was dug in the sand, and at last a
    scanty supply of water was obtained. This resembled the old
    bilge-water of a ship for foulness, but both men and oxen drank
    of it with avidity.</p>

    <p>In the evening, when about to yoke the oxen to the waggon,
    it was found that most of them had run off towards
    Bysondermeid. No time was to be lost, so Moffat instantly sent
    off the remaining oxen with two men to solicit assistance from
    Mr. Bartlett at Pella, <!--photo on page 33-->
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"
    id="page34"></a>{34}</span> while he remained behind with his
    goods. "Three days," said he afterwards, "I remained with my
    waggon-driver on this burning plain, with scarcely a breath of
    wind, and what there was felt as if coming from the mouth of an
    oven. We had only tufts of dry grass to make a small fire or
    rather flame; and little was needed as we had scarcely any food
    to prepare. We saw no human being, not a single antelope or
    beast of prey made its appearance, but in the dead of night we
    sometimes heard the roar of the lion on the mountain. At last
    when we were beginning to fear that the men had either perished
    or wandered, Mr. Bartlett arrived on horseback, with two men
    having a quantity of mutton tied to their saddles. I cannot
    conceive of an epicure gazing on a table groaning under the
    weight of viands, with half the delight that I did on the
    mutton."</p>

    <div class="center">
        <img src="images/0169.jpg" alt="group of people"
        width="640" />
    </div>

    <p>Fresh oxen, accustomed to deep sand, conveyed the weary
    travellers to Pella, where Moffat remained a few days, being
    greatly invigorated in mind and body by the Christian kindness
    of Mr. and Mrs. Bartlett and the friendly attentions of the
    heathen converts.</p>

    <p>Starting again, he came to the Orange River, crossing which
    was generally a work of difficulty at that time. The native
    teacher from Warm Bath, who had come to Pella to conduct Moffat
    to his village, led the missionary to a ford opposite to that
    place. The waggon and its contents were swam over on a fragile
    raft of dry willow logs&mdash;a laborious and tedious
    operation, the raft having to be taken to pieces after each
    journey, and the separate logs conveyed back again by swimmers.
    All the goods being over, Robert was asked to place himself
    upon the raft. Not altogether liking its appearance, and also
    wishing <span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"
    id="page35"></a>{35}</span> to save the natives trouble, he
    took off his clothes and, leaving them to be conveyed across,
    plunged into the stream. The natives were afraid as they saw
    him approach the middle of the current, and some of their most
    expert swimmers sprang in to overtake him, but in vain. When he
    emerged on the northern bank, one of them came up out of breath
    and said, "Were you born in the great sea water?"</p>

    <p>Robert Moffat reached Africaner's kraal on the 26th of
    January, 1818, and was kindly received by Mr. Ebner. The chief
    soon made his appearance, and inquired if the new missionary
    had been appointed by the Directors in London. Receiving an
    affirmative reply, he ordered a number of women to come. Then
    pointing to a spot of ground he said to the women, "There you
    must build a house for the missionary." In half an hour the
    structure was completed, in appearance something like a
    bee-hive. In this frail house, of sticks and native mats,
    Moffat lived for nearly six months, being scorched by the sun,
    drenched by the rain, exposed to the wind, and obliged often to
    decamp through the clouds of dust; in addition to which, any
    dog wishing for a night's lodging could force its way through
    the wall, sometimes to the loss of the missionary's dinner next
    day. A serpent was occasionally found coiled in a corner, or
    the indweller of the habitation had to spring up, in the middle
    of the night, to save himself and his house from being crushed
    to pieces during the nocturnal affrays of the cattle which
    roamed at large. He lived principally upon milk and dried meat,
    until, after a time, he was able to raise a little grain and
    garden stuff.</p>

    <p>A few days after Moffat's arrival, Mr. Ebner departed, so
    that the young missionary was left entirely alone in a trying
    and most difficult position,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"
    id="page36"></a>{36}</span> a stranger in the midst of a
    strange people. "Here I was," said he, "left alone with a
    people suspicious in the extreme; jealous of their rights which
    they had obtained at the point of the sword; and the best of
    whom Mr. Ebner described as a sharp thorn. I had no friend and
    brother with whom I could participate in the communion of
    saints, none to whom I could look for counsel or advice. A
    barren and miserable country; a small salary, about twenty-five
    pounds per annum. No grain, and consequently no bread, and no
    prospect of getting any, from the want of water to cultivate
    the ground, and destitute of the means of sending to the
    Colony. These circumstances led to great searchings of heart,
    to see if I had hitherto aimed at doing and suffering the will
    of Him in whose service I had embarked. Satisfied that I had
    not run unsent, and having in the intricate, and sometimes
    obscure course I had come, heard the still small voice saying,
    'This is the way, walk ye in it,' I was wont to pour out my
    soul among the granite rocks surrounding this station, now in
    sorrow, and then in joy; and more than once I have taken my
    violin, once belonging to Christian Albrecht, and, reclining
    upon one of the huge masses, have, in the stillness of the
    evening, played and sung the well-known hymn, a favourite of my
    mother's&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span>'Awake, my soul, in joyful lays,<br /></span>
            <span>To sing the great Redeemer's
            praise.'"<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Robert Moffat looked to his God for help and guidance, and
    his heart was strengthened.</p>

    <p>At this period the chief, Christian Africaner, was in a
    doubtful state of mind; while Titus, his brother, a man of
    almost reckless courage, was a fearful example of ungodliness,
    and a terror to most of the inhabitants
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"
    id="page37"></a>{37}</span> on the station. Soon after the
    commencement of his stated services&mdash;which were, according
    to the custom of the missionaries at that period, religious
    service morning and evening, and school for three or four hours
    during the day&mdash;the heart of the youthful missionary was
    much cheered by noticing the regular attendance of the chief.
    Although not a fluent reader, the New Testament became his
    constant companion, and a change passed over him apparent to
    all. The lion at whose name many trembled became a lamb, and
    the love of Jesus Christ filled his heart. He who was formerly
    like a fire-brand, spreading discord, enmity, and war among the
    neighbouring tribes, was now ready to make any sacrifice to
    avoid conflict, and besought parties at variance with each
    other to be at peace.</p>

    <p>Even Titus was subdued, and although he never made a
    profession, yet he became a steady and unwavering friend to the
    missionary, and many times ministered to his wants. "I hear
    what you say," he would reply when the truth was pressed upon
    him, "and I think I sometimes understand, but my heart will not
    feel." Two other brothers of the chief, David and Jacobus,
    became believers and zealous assistants in the work of the
    mission.</p>

    <p>The extreme heat endured in the native house, and the
    character of the food, milk and meat only, brought on a severe
    attack of bilious fever, which in the course of two days
    induced delirium. Opening his eyes as soon as consciousness
    returned, Moffat saw his attendant and Africaner sitting beside
    his couch, gazing upon him with eyes full of sympathy and
    tenderness. Taking some calomel he speedily recovered, and was
    soon at his post again.</p>

    <p>The place where Africaner dwelt being quite
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"
    id="page38"></a>{38}</span> unsuitable for a permanent
    mission-station, on account of the scarcity of water, it was
    determined to take a journey northward to examine a country on
    the border of Damaraland, where it was reported that fountains
    of water abounded. There was, however, only one waggon and that
    a cripple, and neither carpenters nor smiths were at the
    station to repair it. Without it they could not go, so after
    thinking the matter over Moffat undertook its repair. Before
    doing so he must needs have a forge, and a forge meant bellows;
    but here was a difficulty, the native bellows were of no use
    for the work in hand. He therefore contrived, by means of two
    goat-skins and a circular piece of board, to make a pair of
    bellows of sufficient power to fan the fire and heat the iron,
    and with a blue granite stone for an anvil, a pair of tongs
    indicative of Vulcan's first efforts, and a hammer, never
    intended for its present use, he successfully accomplished his
    task, and afterwards repaired some gun-locks, which were as
    essential for the comfort and success of the journey as the
    waggon.</p>

    <p>The party that set out was a large one, including Africaner,
    three of his brothers, and Moffat. The country which they
    passed through was sterile in the extreme, and the expedition
    proved a failure. They therefore returned home again after an
    absence of a few weeks. The school and mission services were
    resumed, but, as David and Jacobus Africaner were now able
    assistants, Moffat undertook itinerating visits on a more
    extensive scale than he had done before. For this purpose Titus
    presented him with his only horse. Previously Moffat had ridden
    upon a bullock with horns, a dangerous practice, as, if the
    bullock stumbles, the rider may be thrown forward and
    transfixed upon them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"
    id="page39"></a>{39}</span></p>

    <p>Privations and dangers frequently attended these itinerating
    journeys. Referring to one of them Robert Moffat states, "After
    tying my Bible and hymn-book in a blanket to the back of my
    saddle, and taking a good draught of milk, I started with my
    interpreter, who rode upon an ox. We had our guns, but nothing
    in our purse or scrip, save a pipe, some tobacco, and a
    tinder-box. After a hot day's ride to reach a village, the
    people would give us a draught of sweet milk, and then old and
    young, assembling in a nook of the fold, among the kine, would
    listen to my address on the great concerns of their soul's
    salvation. I exhorted those who could read to read to others
    and try to teach them to do the same, promising them a reward
    in heaven, for I had none to give on earth. When service was
    over, having taken another draught of milk, and renewed my
    conversation with the people, I lay down on a mat to repose for
    the night. Sometimes a kind housewife would hang a bamboos, a
    wooden vessel filled with milk, on a forked stick near my head,
    that I might, if necessary, drink during the night."</p>

    <p>Once he slept on the ground near the hut in which the
    principal man of the village and his wife reposed. During the
    night a noise as of cattle broken loose was heard. In the
    morning he remarked upon this to his host, when that individual
    replied, "Oh, I was looking at the spoor this morning, it was
    the lion!" adding that a few nights previously a goat had been
    seized from the very spot on which Moffat had been sleeping.
    Upon Moffat asking him why he had put him to sleep there, the
    man replied, "Oh, the lion would not have the audacity to jump
    over on you."</p>

    <p>Sometimes it happened that after travelling all day, hoping
    to reach a village at night, the travellers would
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"
    id="page40"></a>{40}</span> find when they got to the place
    that all the people had gone. Then hungry and thirsty they had
    to pass the night. In the morning after searching for water,
    and partaking of a draught if they were successful in finding
    it, they would start off again with their hunger unsatisfied,
    and deem themselves fortunate if they overtook the migrating
    party that evening.</p>

    <p>Of his ordinary manner of living at this time, he says, "My
    food was milk and meat, living for weeks together on one, and
    then for a while on the other, and again on both together. All
    was well so long as I had either, but sometimes they both
    failed, and there were no shops in the country where I could
    have purchased, and, had there been any, I must have bought on
    credit, for money I had none."</p>

    <p>His wardrobe bore the same impress of poverty as his larder.
    The clothes received when in London soon went to pieces, and
    the knowledge of sewing and knitting, unwillingly learnt from
    his mother, often now stood him in good stead. She once showed
    him how a shirt might be smoothed by folding it properly and
    hammering it with a piece of wood. Resolving one day to have a
    nice one for the Sabbath, Moffat tried this plan. He folded the
    shirt carefully, laid it on a smooth block of stone&mdash;not a
    hearth-stone, but a block of fine granite&mdash;and hammered
    away. "What are you doing?" said Africaner. "Smoothing my
    shirt," replied his white friend. "That is one way," said he,
    and so it was, for on holding the shirt up to the light it was
    seen to be riddled with holes. "When I left the country," said
    Moffat, "I had not half-a-dozen shirts with two sleeves
    apiece."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"
    id="page41"></a>{41}</span></p>

    <div class="center">
        <img src="images/0170.jpg" alt="lion" width="640" />
    </div>

    <p>Robert Moffat's stay in Namaqualand extended to a little
    over twelve months. Near its close he made on Africaner's
    account&mdash;with the view of ascertaining
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"
    id="page42"></a>{42}</span> the suitability of a place for
    settlement&mdash;a journey to the Griqua country, and after a
    terrible experience, in which he suffered from hunger, thirst,
    heat, and drinking poisoned water, he reached Griqua Town, and
    entered the house of Mr. Anderson, the missionary there,
    speechless, haggard, emaciated, and covered with perspiration,
    making the inmates understand by signs that he needed water.
    Here he was most kindly entertained, and after a few days
    started back again. The return journey was almost as trying as
    the outward one, but he reached Vreede Berg (Africaner's
    village) in safety. The chief received Moffat's account of his
    researches with entire satisfaction, but the removal of himself
    and people was allowed to remain prospective for a season.</p>

    <p>Missionary labours were resumed. The school flourished, and
    the attendance at the Sabbath services was most encouraging.
    The people were so strongly attached to their missionary, that
    although he was contemplating a visit to the Cape, he dared not
    mention the subject to them. In a letter written at this time,
    alluding to his every-day life, he says, "I have many
    difficulties to encounter, being alone. No one can do anything
    for me in my household affairs. I must attend to everything,
    which often confuses me, and, indeed, hinders me in my work,
    for I could wish to have almost nothing to do but to instruct
    the heathen, both spiritually and temporally. Daily I do a
    little in the garden, daily I am doing something for the people
    in mending guns. I am carpenter, smith, cooper, shoemaker,
    miller, baker, and housekeeper&mdash;the last is the most
    burdensome of any. An old Namaqua woman milks my cows, makes a
    fire, and washes. All other things I do myself, though I seldom
    prepare anything till impelled by
    hunger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"
    id="page43"></a>{43}</span> I drink plenty of milk, and often
    eat a piece of dry meat. Lately I reaped nearly two bolls of
    wheat from two hatfuls which I sowed. This is of great help to
    me. I shall soon have plenty of Indian corn, cabbages, melons,
    and potatoes. Water is scarce. I have sown wheat a second time
    on trial. I live chiefly now on bread and milk. To-day I
    churned about three Scotch pints of milk, from which there were
    two pounds of butter, so you may conceive that the milk is
    rich. I wish many times that my mother saw me. My house is
    always clean, but oh what a confusion there is among my
    linen."</p>

    <p>In November, 1818, letters reached Robert Moffat from
    England. One came from Miss Smith, in which that young lady
    stated that she had most reluctantly renounced hope of ever
    getting abroad, her father determining never to allow her to do
    so. This was a sore trial, but it only led the child closer to
    his Father, and that Father, who doeth all things well, in His
    own good time, brought to pass that which now seemed
    impossible.</p>

    <p>Early in 1819, circumstances required Mr. Moffat to visit
    Cape Town. Conversing with Africaner on the state and prospects
    of missions, the idea flashed into Moffat's mind that it would
    be well for that chief to accompany him, and he suggested it to
    his coloured friend. Africaner was astonished. "I had thought
    you loved me," said he, "and do you advise me to go to the
    Government to be hung up as a spectacle of public justice?"
    Then, putting his hand to his head, he said, "Do you not know
    that I am an outlaw, and that one thousand rix-dollars have
    been offered for this poor head?" After a little while he
    replied to the missionary's arguments by saying, "I shall
    deliberate and <i>roll</i> (using the words of the
    Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"
    id="page44"></a>{44}</span> Version of the Bible) my way upon
    the Lord. I know He will not leave me."</p>

    <div class="center">
        <img src="images/0171.jpg" alt="AFRICANER" width="500" />

        <h4>AFRICANER.</h4>
    </div><br />


    <p>To get Africaner safely through the territories of the Dutch
    farmers to the Cape was a hazardous proceeding, as the
    atrocities he had committed were not forgotten, and hatred
    against him still rankled in many a breast. However, attired in
    one of the only two substantial shirts Moffat had left, a pair
    of leather trousers, a duffel jacket, much the worse for wear,
    and an old hat, neither white nor black, the attempt was made,
    the chief passing as one of the missionary's attendants. His
    master's costume was scarcely more refined than his own.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"
    id="page45"></a>{45}</span> As a whole, the Dutch farmers were
    kind and hospitable to strangers, and as Moffat reached their
    farms, some of them congratulated him on returning alive, they
    having been assured that Africaner had long since murdered him.
    At one farm a novel and amusing instance occurred of the state
    of feeling concerning them both. As they drew near to this
    place, Moffat directed his men to take his waggon to the valley
    below while he walked towards the house, which was situated on
    an eminence. As he advanced the farmer came forward slowly to
    meet him. Stretching forth his hand with the customary
    salutation, the farmer put his hand behind him, and asked who
    the stranger was. The stranger replied that he was Moffat.</p>

    <p>"Moffat!" exclaimed the sturdy Boer in a faltering voice,
    "it is your ghost!"</p>

    <p>"I am no ghost," said the supposed phantom.</p>

    <p>"Don't come near me," said the farmer, "you have been long
    since murdered by Africaner. Everybody says you were murdered,
    and a man told me he had seen your bones."</p>

    <p>As the farmer feared the presence of the supposed ghost
    would alarm his wife, both wended their way to the waggon,
    Africaner being the subject of conversation as they walked
    along. Moffat declared his opinion that the chief was then a
    truly good man.</p>

    <p>"I can believe almost anything you say," said the Boer, "but
    that I cannot credit."</p>

    <p>Finally he closed the conversation by saying with much
    earnestness: "Well, if what you assert be true respecting that
    man, I have only one wish, and that is to see him before I die,
    and when you return, as sure as the sun is over our heads, I
    will go with you to see him, though he killed my own
    uncle."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"
    id="page46"></a>{46}</span></p>

    <p>The farmer was a good man, who had showed Moffat kindness on
    his way to Namaqualand. Knowing his sincerity and the goodness
    of his disposition, Moffat turned to the man sitting by the
    waggon, and addressing the farmer said, "This, then, is
    Africaner."</p>

    <p>With a start, and a look as though the man might have
    dropped from the clouds, the worthy Boer exclaimed, "Are
    <i>you</i> Africaner?"</p>

    <p>Africaner arose, doffed his old hat, and making a polite bow
    replied, "I am."</p>

    <p>The farmer seemed thunderstruck, but on realising the fact,
    lifted up his eyes and said, "O God, what a miracle of Thy
    power! what cannot Thy grace accomplish!"</p>

    <p>On reaching Cape Town, Robert Moffat waited upon Lord
    Charles Somerset, the Governor, and informed him that Africaner
    was in the town. The information was received with some amount
    of scepticism, but the following day was appointed for an
    interview with him.</p>

    <p>The Governor received the chief with great affability and
    kindness, and expressed his pleasure at thus seeing before him,
    one who had formerly been the scourge of the country, and the
    terror of the border colonists. He was much struck with this
    palpable result of missionary enterprise, and presented
    Africaner with an excellent waggon, valued at eighty
    pounds.</p>

    <p>Moffat visited the colony on this occasion with two objects;
    first, to secure supplies, and secondly, to introduce Africaner
    to the notice of the Colonial Government. Having accomplished
    these, he fully intended to return to his flock. Events were,
    however, ordered otherwise.</p>

    <p>While Moffat was in Cape Town, a deputation
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"
    id="page47"></a>{47}</span> from the London Missionary Society,
    consisting of the Rev. J. Campbell, and the Rev. Dr. Philip,
    was also there. It was the wish of these two gentleman that he
    should accompany them in their visits to the missionary
    stations, and eventually be appointed to the Bechwana
    mission.</p>

    <p>The proposition was a startling one, but after careful
    thought, and with the entire concurrence of Africaner&mdash;who
    hoped to move with his tribe to the neighbourhood of the new
    mission&mdash;Moffat accepted it. Africaner therefore departed
    alone, generously offering to take in his waggon to Lattakoo,
    the new station, the missionary's books and a few articles of
    furniture that he had purchased.</p>

    <p>Once more these two brethren in the faith met on this earth,
    and this was at Lattakoo. The proposed removal of the tribe,
    however, never took place, Africaner being called up higher
    before that plan could be carried out.</p>

    <p>The closing scene in the life of this remarkable man was
    depicted by the Rev. J. Archbell, Wesleyan missionary, in a
    letter to Dr. Philip, dated the 14th of March,
    1823:&mdash;"When he found his end approaching, he called all
    the people together, and gave them directions as to their
    future conduct. 'We are not,' said he, 'what we
    were,&mdash;<i>savages</i>, but men professing to be taught
    according to the Gospel. Let us then do accordingly. Live
    peaceably with all men, if possible; and if impossible, consult
    those who are placed over you before you engage in anything.
    Remain together, as you have done since I knew you. Then, when
    the Directors think fit to send you a missionary, you may be
    ready to receive him. Behave to any teacher you may have sent
    as one sent of God, as I have great
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"
    id="page48"></a>{48}</span> hope that God will bless you in
    this respect when I am gone to heaven. I feel that I love God,
    and that He has done much for me, of which I am totally
    unworthy,'</p>

    <p>"He also added, 'My former life is stained with blood; but
    Jesus Christ has pardoned me, and I am going to heaven. Oh!
    beware of falling into the same evils into which I have led you
    frequently; but seek God, and He will be found of you to direct
    you,'"</p>

    <p>Shortly after this he died.</p>

    <h3>MARRIAGE, AND ARRIVAL AT LATTAKOO.</h3>

    <p>Up to this time, Robert Moffat had pursued his course alone.
    No loving helpmeet had cheered him in his efforts, or with
    womanly tenderness ministered to his wants. But though far
    away, he was fondly remembered and earnestly prayed for,
    especially by one noble Christian lady, over whose fair head
    scarce twenty-three summers had passed, and whose heart had
    been torn with the severe struggle, between filial love and
    regard for her parents on the one hand, and her sense of duty
    and affection for her missionary friend on the other, which for
    two and a-half years had been carried on therein.</p>

    <p>At last, when hope seemed to have vanished, the parents of
    Mary Smith, to whom the idea of parting with their only
    daughter was painful in the extreme, saw so clearly that it was
    the Lord who was calling their child to the work which He had
    marked out for her, that they felt they dare not any longer
    withhold her from it, and therefore calmly resigned their
    daughter into His hands. Thus it came to pass that,&mdash;after
    a short stay in London, and at Cowes, in the Isle of Wight, at
    which places she won all hearts by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"
    id="page50"></a>{50}</span> her unfeigned and exalted piety and
    zeal, and by her modest, affectionate manner,&mdash;we find her
    on board the sailing-ship <i>British Colony</i>, on her way to
    South Africa, in the care of the Rev. R. Beck, a minister of
    the Dutch Church, and his wife.</p>

    <p>As arranged, the deputation, accompanied by Robert Moffat,
    left Cape Town on their tour of inspection of the stations in
    the eastern part of the Colony and in Kafirland. This journey
    necessitated an absence of twelve months, during which time
    Robert expected his bride to arrive. This was a trial of faith,
    as it seemed hard that she should be obliged to land in a
    strange country, and find none of her own to welcome her. But
    with Moffat even love followed after duty.</p>

    <p>It so happened, however, that after visiting the line of
    stations through the eastern districts as far as Bethelsdorp,
    the party, at that place, found their progress effectually
    barred through war with the Kafirs. They were therefore obliged
    to return to Cape Town, thus giving Moffat the opportunity and
    great joy of receiving his affianced wife upon her landing from
    the vessel. She reached Cape Town in safety, and on the 27th of
    December, 1819, the happy couple were united. They received
    each other as from the Lord, and for more than fifty years,
    during cloud and sunshine, their union was a true and blessed
    one.</p>

    <p>Robert Moffat had been appointed to the Bechwana station at
    Lattakoo, or Kuruman, as it was afterwards called; and for that
    place the missionary party, which consisted of the Rev. John
    Campbell and the Moffats, set out early in the year 1820.</p>

    <p>A feeble attempt to establish a mission to the Bechwanas had
    been made, by the Dutch Missionary Society in Cape Town, as
    early as A.D. 1800, and two
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"
    id="page51"></a>{51}</span> missionaries, named Edwards and
    Kok, had been despatched. They were directed by the chief to
    settle on the banks of the Kuruman River, at a distance from
    the natives, and the effort degenerated into a mere trading
    concern. In 1805, the Bechwanas were visited by the celebrated
    traveller Dr. Lichtenstein, and, in 1812, by Dr. Burchell, but
    it was not until the visit of the Rev. J. Campbell, a little
    later, that any real negotiations were entertained for the
    settlement of missionaries with this people. The chief,
    Mothibi, then said to Mr. Campbell, "send missionaries, and I
    will be a father to them."</p>

    <p>In response to this invitation Messrs. Evans and Hamilton
    left England in 1815, and, full of hope, reached Lattakoo on
    the 17th of February in the following year. Instead of being
    received as they anticipated, they were repulsed, and directed
    to settle at the Kuruman River, thirty miles distant.
    Disappointed and despondent they returned to Griqua Town. Mr.
    Evans relinquished the mission, but a further attempt was made
    afterwards by Messrs. Read and Hamilton, and this time
    permission was obtained for them to dwell with the chief and
    his people. Thus the Bechwana Mission obtained its first real
    footing.</p>

    <p>In June, 1817, the tribe, under Mothibi, removed from the
    position where the missionaries first found it, and settled by
    the Kuruman River. When the Rev. J. Campbell returned, to the
    Colony, Mr. Read accompanied him; thus, pending the arrival of
    Robert Moffat, Mr. Hamilton was left alone in charge of the
    mission.</p>

    <p>The journey as far as Griqua Town was accomplished without
    any special incident. At first the route lay through fertile
    valleys and lovely mountain scenery, but soon this changed, and
    for hundreds of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"
    id="page52"></a>{52}</span> miles the travellers had to pass
    through the desolate region of the Karroo desert. When about
    half-way through this sterile district, they came to the site
    upon which was to be built the village of Beaufort West, where
    they were most kindly entertained by a Scotchman named Mr.
    Baird, the newly appointed magistrate.</p>

    <p>The Orange River, so frequently an insurmountable obstacle
    to progress, was passed in safety, the water being very low,
    and two or three days later Griqua Town was reached. Here a
    halt was made. Lattakoo lay one hundred miles beyond.</p>

    <p>At this time some uncertainty existed as to whether the
    Moffats would be allowed by the Colonial Government to settle
    at Lattakoo; thus far consent had been withheld. They had
    advanced trusting that the way would be opened, and after a
    short rest at Griqua Town, the party continued their journey,
    and reached Lattakoo five days after leaving the Griqua
    station. It was intended that Robert Moffat should take the
    place of Mr. Read, as an associate with Mr. Hamilton in the
    work of the mission.</p>

    <p>The new arrivals were introduced to Mothibi, and were soon
    visited by a retinue of chiefs. The manner, appearance, and
    dress of these natives much interested Mary Moffat. The whole
    missionary party stayed together for three weeks, settling the
    affairs of the mission; then the Rev. J. Campbell and Mr. Read
    started on a journey to visit the Bahurutsi, a tribe who dwelt
    nearly two hundred miles to the north-east of Lattakoo. Moffat
    and his wife remained with Mr. Hamilton, so that the new
    missionary might win the affections of the Bechwana chief and
    his people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"
    id="page53"></a>{53}</span></p>

    <div class="center">
        <img src="images/0174.jpg"
        alt="pulling a big wagon up a hill" width="640" />
    </div>

    <p>Upon the return of the Rev. J. Campbell and Mr. Read, after
    an absence of two months, and a short
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"
    id="page54"></a>{54}</span> rest at Lattakoo, all the
    missionaries, excepting Mr. Hamilton, set off westward along
    the bed of the Kuruman River to visit several of the Bechwana
    tribes which were scattered about that region. The natives of
    these parts, never having seen white people before evinced much
    curiosity concerning their visitors; especially about Mrs.
    Moffat and her dress. To see the missionaries sitting at table
    dining and using knives and forks, plates, and different
    dishes, was wonderful to them, and for hours they would sit and
    gaze upon such scenes. The Word of Life was preached to these
    natives by either Mr. Campbell or Robert Moffat as the party
    journeyed along.</p>

    <p>Their absence from Lattakoo extended to a little over a
    fortnight, and on their return, finding, by intelligence
    received from Dr. Philip, that permission had not as yet been
    obtained from the Governor for the Moffats to settle at that
    place, Robert and his partner had to return, much cast down, to
    Griqua Town, there to commit the matter into the hand of God,
    and patiently await the time when He should open the way for
    them to commence the work they had so much at heart. Mr.
    Hamilton was therefore again left alone with simply a Griqua
    assistant and a few Hottentots.</p>

    <p>Just before leaving Lattakoo, Robert Moffat met Africaner,
    who had safely brought from Vreede Berg the cattle and property
    belonging to the missionary, and also the books and articles of
    furniture which had been intrusted to his care when leaving
    Cape Town. All were in good order, particular attention having
    been paid to the missionary's cattle and sheep during his long
    absence. This was the last meeting between Moffat and
    Africaner.</p>

    <p>While on their journey, and when near
    Griqua<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"
    id="page55"></a>{55}</span> Town, information reached the
    missionary party that permission had been granted for the
    Moffats to settle at Lattakoo. As, however, the affairs at
    Griqua Town at this time were altogether disorganised, it was
    arranged that they should stay there for a few months to set
    the affairs of that place in order.</p>

    <p>During their stay at that station Mrs. Moffat had a severe
    illness, and her life was despaired of, but this precious life
    was preserved, and not only was his dear one restored, but a
    bonny wee lassie was given to them both, who was named Mary,
    and who, in after years, became the wife of Dr.
    Livingstone.</p>

        <h4>OLD MISSION HOUSE AT GRIQUA TOWN.</h4>
    </div>

    <p>At Griqua Town they bade farewell to the Rev. J. Campbell.
    To them he had become much endeared, as they had been in his
    company as fellow-travellers for many months. He and Mr. Read
    returned to the Colony; twenty years later, however, the two
    friends met again, but that was upon the Moffats' return to
    their native land.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"
    id="page56"></a>{56}</span></p>

    <p>In May, 1821, Mr. and Mrs. Moffat again arrived at Lattakoo,
    and then commenced a continuation of missionary conflicts
    during which their faith was severely tried, but which ended,
    after many years, in triumphant rejoicing as they saw the
    people brought to Christ, and beheld the once ignorant and
    degraded heathen becoming humble servants of the Lord, reading
    His Word and obeying His precepts.</p>

    <p>In looking at the Bechwanas as they were when the Moffats
    first settled among them, for up to that time the efforts of
    the missionaries had been unattended with success, we find a
    people who had neither an idea of a God, nor who performed any
    idolatrous rites; who failed to see that there was anything
    more agreeable to flesh and blood in our customs than in their
    own; but who allowed that the missionaries were a wiser and
    superior race of beings to themselves; who practised polygamy,
    and looked with a very jealous eye on any innovation that was
    likely to deprive them of the services of their wives, who
    built their houses, gathered firewood for their fires, tilled
    their fields, and reared their families; who were suspicious,
    and keenly scrutinised the actions of the missionaries; in
    fact, a people who were thoroughly sensual, and who could rob,
    lie, and murder without any compunctions of conscience, as long
    as success attended their efforts.</p>

    <p>Among such a people did these servants of God labour for
    years without any sign of fruit, but with steadfast faith and
    persevering prayer, until at last the work of the Holy Spirit
    was seen, and the strong arm of the Lord, gathering many into
    His fold, became apparent.</p>

    <p>The Bechwana tribe with whom Robert Moffat was located was
    called the Batlaping, or Batlapis.</p>

    <p>The patience of the missionaries in these early days
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"
    id="page57"></a>{57}</span> was sorely tried, and the petty
    annoyances, so irritating to many of us, were neither few nor
    infrequent. By dint of immense labour, leading the water to it,
    the ground which the chief had given the missionaries for a
    garden was made available; then the women, headed by the
    chief's wife, encroached upon it, and to save contention the
    point was conceded. The corn when it ripened was stolen, and
    the sheep either taken out of the fold at night or driven off
    when grazing in the day time. No tool or household utensil
    could be left about for a moment or it would disappear.</p>

    <p>One day Mr. Hamilton, who at that time had no mill to grind
    corn, sat down and with much labour and perspiration, by means
    of two stones, ground sufficient meal in half-a-day to make a
    loaf that should serve him, being then alone, for about eight
    days. He kneaded and baked his gigantic loaf, put it on his
    shelf, and went to the chapel. He returned in the evening with
    a keen appetite and a pleasant anticipation of enjoying his
    coarse home-made bread, but on opening the door of his hut and
    casting his eye to the shelf he saw that the loaf had gone.
    Someone had forced open the little window of the hut, got in,
    and stolen the bread.</p>

    <p>On another occasion Mrs. Moffat, with a babe in her arms,
    begged very humbly of a woman, just to be kind enough to move
    out of a temporary kitchen, that she might shut it as usual
    before going into the place of worship. The woman seized a
    piece of wood to hurl at Mrs. Moffat's head, who, therefore,
    escaped to the house of God, leaving the intruder in
    undisturbed possession of the kitchen, any of the contents of
    which she would not hesitate to appropriate to her own use.</p>

    <p>A severe drought also set in, and a rain-maker, finding all
    his arts to bring rain useless, laid the blame
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"
    id="page58"></a>{58}</span> upon the white strangers, who for a
    time were in expectation of being driven away. Probably,
    however, the greatest trial at this time was caused by the
    conduct of some of the Hottentots who had accompanied them from
    the Cape, and who being but new converts were weak to withstand
    the demands made upon them, and brought shame upon their
    leaders. Shortly after his arrival Moffat thoroughly purged his
    little community. The numbers that gathered round the Lord's
    table were much reduced, but the lesson was a salutary one and
    did good to the heathen around.</p>

    <p>A callous indifference to the instruction of the
    missionaries, except it was followed by some temporal benefit,
    prevailed. In August, 1822, Mary Moffat wrote, "We have no
    prosperity in the work, not the least sign of good being done.
    The Bechwanas seem more careless than ever, and seldom enter
    the church." A little later Moffat himself stated in one of his
    letters, "They turn a deaf ear to the voice of love, and treat
    with scorn the glorious doctrines of salvation. It is, however,
    pleasing to reflect that affairs in general wear a more hopeful
    aspect than when we came here. Several instances have proved
    the people are determined to relinquish the barbarous system of
    commandoes for stealing cattle. They have also dispensed with a
    rain-maker this season."</p>

    <p>The Bushmen had a most inhuman custom of abandoning the aged
    and helpless, leaving them to starve or be devoured by wild
    beasts; also if a mother died it was their practice to bury the
    infant or infants of that mother with her.</p>

    <p>During one of his journeys, a few months prior to the date
    last mentioned, Moffat came upon a party of Bushmen digging a
    grave for the body of a woman who had left two children.
    Finding that they were <span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"
    id="page59"></a>{59}</span> about to bury the children with the
    corpse he begged for them. They were given him and for some
    years formed a part of his household. They were named Ann and
    Dicky.</p>

    <p>The importance of acquiring the language of the Bechwanas
    soon became apparent to the earnest-hearted missionary. One day
    he was much cast down and said to his wife, "Mary, this is hard
    work." "It is hard work, my love," she replied, "but take
    courage, our lives shall be given us for a prey." "But think,
    my dear," he said, "how long we have been preaching to this
    people, and no fruit yet appears." The wise woman made answer,
    "The Gospel has not yet been preached to them <i>in their own
    tongue in which they were born</i>. They have heard it only
    through interpreters, and interpreters who have themselves no
    just understanding, no real love of the truth. We must not
    expect the blessing till you are able, from your own lips and
    in their language, to bring it through their ears into their
    hearts."</p>

    <p>"From that hour," said Moffat, in relating the conversation,
    "I gave myself with untiring diligence to the acquisition of
    the language."</p>

    <p>As an instance of the drawback of preaching by means of an
    interpreter, the sentence, "The salvation of the soul is a very
    important subject," was rendered by one of those individuals as
    follows: "The salvation of the soul is a very great sack." A
    rendering altogether unintelligible.</p>

    <p>For the purpose of studying the language Moffat made
    journeys among the tribes, so that he might for a time be freed
    from speaking Dutch, the language spoken with his own people at
    Lattakoo. Itinerating visits were also made in turn every
    Sabbath to the surrounding villages, and occasionally further
    afield, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"
    id="page60"></a>{60}</span> but sometimes, after walking
    perhaps four to five miles to reach a village, not a single
    individual could be found to listen to the Gospel message.</p>

    <p>The only service in which the missionaries took any real
    delight at this time, was the Sabbath evening service held in
    Dutch for the edification of themselves and the two or three
    Hottentots, with their families, who belonged to the
    mission.</p>

    <p>In addition to sore privations, discouragements, false
    accusations, and the loss of their property, the missionaries
    found even their lives at times imperilled. The natives and all
    on the station were suffering greatly from a long continued
    drought. All the efforts of the professional rain-maker had
    been in vain, no cloud appeared in the sky, no rain fell to
    water the parched land. The doings of the missionaries were
    looked upon as being the cause of this misfortune. At one time
    it was a bag of salt, which Moffat had brought in his waggon,
    that frightened the rain away; at another the sound of the
    chapel bell. Their prospects became darker than ever. At last
    it appeared that the natives had fully decided to expel them
    from their midst. A chief man, and about a dozen of his
    attendants, came and seated themselves under the shadow of a
    large tree near to Moffat's house. He at that moment was
    engaged in repairing a waggon near at hand. The scene which
    ensued and its result we give in his own
    words:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"
    id="page61"></a>{61}</span></p>

    <p>"Being informed that something of importance was to be
    communicated, Mr. Hamilton was called. We stood patiently to
    hear the message, always ready to face the worst. The principal
    speaker informed us, that it was the determination of the
    chiefs of the people that we should leave the country; and
    referring to our disregard of threatenings, added what was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"
    id="page62"></a>{62}</span> tantamount to the assurance that
    measures of a violent character would be resorted to, to carry
    their resolutions into effect, in case of our disobeying the
    order.</p>

    <div class="center">
        <img src="images/0176.jpg"
        alt="&quot;NOW THEN, IF YOU WILL DRIVE YOUR SPEARS TO MY HEART.&quot;"

             width="640" />

        <h4>"NOW THEN, IF YOU WILL DRIVE YOUR SPEARS TO MY
        HEART."</h4>
    </div>

    <p>"While the chief was speaking, he stood quivering his spear
    in his right hand. Mrs. Moffat was at the door of our cottage,
    with the babe in her arms, watching the crisis, for such it
    was. We replied:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"'We have indeed felt most reluctant to leave, and are now
    more than ever resolved to abide by our post. We pity you, for
    you know not what you do; we have suffered, it is true; and He
    whose servants we are has directed us in His Word, "When they
    persecute you in one city, flee ye to another," but although we
    have suffered, we do not consider all that has been done to us
    by the people amounts to persecution; we are prepared to expect
    it from such as know no better. If you are resolved to rid
    yourselves of us, you must resort to stronger measures, for our
    hearts are with you. You may shed blood or burn us out. We know
    you will not touch our wives and children.'"</p>

    <p>Then throwing open his waistcoat Moffat stood erect and
    fearless. "Now then," said he, "if you will, drive your spears
    to my heart; and when you have slain me, my companions will
    know that the hour has come for them to depart."</p>

    <p>At these words the chief man looked at his companions,
    remarking, with a significant shake of the head, "These men
    must have ten lives, when they are so fearless of death; there
    must be something in immortality."</p>

    <p>Moffat pithily observes, "The meeting broke up, and they
    left us, no doubt fully impressed with the idea that we were
    impracticable men."</p>

    <h3>THE MANTATEE INVASION.</h3>

    <p>In March, 1823, a second daughter was born to the Moffats,
    who was named Ann. At that time the Batlaping were thoroughly
    indifferent to the Gospel, but their hostile spirit to the
    missionaries had passed away.</p>

    <p>Robert Moffat had heard of a powerful Bechwana tribe, named
    the Bangwaketsi, whose chief was Makaba, dwelling about two
    hundred miles to the north-east. To this chief and people he
    now contemplated paying a visit.</p>

    <p>Rumours had also been current at intervals, for more than a
    year past, of strange and terrible doings by a fierce and
    numerous people, called the Mantatees, who were advancing from
    the eastward. To gain definite intelligence concerning this
    people, and also with the view of paying his contemplated visit
    to Makaba, Moffat resolved upon undertaking a journey to that
    chief. He was also influenced by the desire to open up a
    friendly intercourse with so powerful, and it might be
    dangerous, a potentate as Makaba; and likewise by the wish of
    gaining opportunities of more fully studying the language and
    becoming acquainted with the localities of the tribes; the
    ulti<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"
    id="page64"></a>{64}</span> mate design of all being the
    introduction of the Gospel among them.</p>

    <p>An invitation arrived from Makaba, and the way seemed open.
    Mothibi, however, the Bechwana chief, was greatly averse to the
    undertaking, and threw all possible obstacles in its path,
    short of actual armed resistance. His people were forbidden to
    accompany the missionary, who was obliged therefore to start
    with only the few men he had.</p>

    <p>As he journeyed forward the reports concerning the Mantatees
    were again heard, and on reaching Nokaneng, about twenty miles
    distant from Lattakoo, he learned that the invaders had
    attacked a Bechwana tribe, the Barolongs, at Kunuana, about one
    hundred miles off. Spies were sent out but returned without any
    definite tidings, and the journey was resumed.</p>

    <p>For four days the party travelled across a dry and trackless
    country, when they came to a fine valley, in which were some
    pools and plenty of game. Here they remained two days, and then
    prepared to continue their journey to the Bangwaketsi. Just as
    they were about to start, however, they ascertained from two
    natives that the Mantatees had attacked the Barolongs, and were
    in possession of a village somewhat in the rear of the
    missionary's party.</p>

    <p>No time was to be lost. The distance was retraced with all
    speed, and the alarming news told at Lattakoo. A public meeting
    was convened, and Moffat gave a circumstantial account of the
    information he had gathered. The enemy were a numerous and
    powerful body, they had destroyed many towns of the Bakone
    tribes, slaughtered immense numbers of people, laid Kurrechane
    in ruins, scattered the Barolongs, and, in addition, were said
    to be cannibals.</p>

    <p>The alarming tidings produced at first, a gloom on
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"
    id="page65"></a>{65}</span> every countenance, and silence
    reigned for a few minutes. Then Mothibi, in the name of the
    assembly, said he was exceedingly thankful that their
    missionary had been "hard-headed" and pursued his journey, thus
    discovering to them their danger.</p>

    <p>Moffat counselled that as the Bechwanas were quite unable to
    resist so savage a force as the Mantatees, they had better
    either flee to the Colony or call in the aid of the Griquas,
    volunteering to proceed to Griqua Town to give information and
    procure assistance. The chief at that place was one Andries
    Waterboer, who had been educated by the missionaries, and who,
    before his election as chief, had been set apart for a native
    teacher. Mr. Melville, the Government agent, also resided in
    the town.</p>

    <p>Moffat reached Griqua Town safely, and Waterboer promised to
    come to the assistance of the Bechwanas as soon as he could
    muster his forces. Moffat then returned to his station.</p>

    <p>Eleven anxious days were passed at Lattakoo, waiting the
    arrival of the Griquas. By the time they arrived, the enemy had
    reached Letakong, only thirty-six miles away. The Griqua force
    consisted of about one hundred horsemen, armed with guns, and
    it being reported that there were white men among the invaders,
    Moffat was asked to accompany the force, as, having some
    knowledge of the language, he might be able to bring about a
    treaty with them. He agreed to go, and Mr. Melville started
    with him.</p>

    <p>Before leaving, all met to pray for Divine counsel and help.
    A blessing on the means of preventing a further effusion of
    blood was asked, and if recourse to violent measures became
    necessary, it was prayed that the heads of those engaged might
    be shielded in the day of
    battle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"
    id="page66"></a>{66}</span></p>

    <p>The small force pressed forward as far as the Matlaurin
    River, about half way, where all bivouacked. Leaving the main
    body, Waterboer, Moffat, and a few others, rode onward for
    about four hours, and then halted for the night among some
    trees. At day-light they proceeded until they came in sight of
    the enemy. These were divided into two parties, one holding a
    town, out of which they had driven the inhabitants, and the
    other lying on the hills to the left of the town. As the
    horsemen drew near, they could perceive that they were
    discovered, and among the masses of the invaders could be seen
    the war-axes and brass ornaments as they glittered in the
    sun.</p>

    <p>Riding forward, Moffat and Waterboer found a young woman
    belonging to the Mantatees, whose whole appearance denoted
    direful want. Food was given her, and some tobacco, and she was
    sent with a message to her people that the strangers wanted to
    speak with them and not to fight. An old man and a lad were
    also found dying of starvation, these were helped and talked to
    in full sight of the enemy. All possible means were tried to
    bring them to a parley, but in vain, they only responded by
    making furious rushes, showing their intention to attack.</p>

    <p>The whole day was spent in this manner, and at evening
    Moffat left Waterboer and the scouts, and rode back to confer
    with Mr. Melville and the other Griqua chiefs, to see if some
    means could be devised of preventing the dreadful consequences
    of battle. One of the Griqua chiefs, named Cornelius Kok, nobly
    insisted on Moffat taking his best horse, one of the strongest
    present. To this generous act the missionary afterwards owed
    his life.</p>

    <p>All the party were in motion the next morning before
    day-light. The whole of the horsemen advanced
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"
    id="page67"></a>{67}</span> to within about one hundred and
    fifty yards of the enemy, thinking to intimidate them and bring
    them to a conference. The Mantatees rushed forward with a
    terrible howl, throwing their war clubs and javelins. The
    rushes becoming dangerous, Waterboer and his party commenced
    firing, and the battle became general. The Mantatees
    obstinately held their ground, seeming determined rather to
    perish than flee, which they might easily have done.</p>

    <p>After the combat had lasted two hours and a-half, the
    Griquas, finding their ammunition rapidly diminishing, advanced
    to take the enemy's position. The latter gave way and fled, at
    first westward, but being intercepted, they turned towards the
    town. Here a desperate struggle took place. At last, seized
    with despair, the enemy fled precipitately, and were pursued by
    the Griquas for about eight miles.</p>

    <p>Soon after the battle commenced, the Bechwanas who
    accompanied the Griqua force came up, and began discharging
    their poisoned arrows into the midst of the Mantatees.
    Half-a-dozen of these fierce warriors, however, turned upon
    them, and the whole body scampered off in wild disorder. But as
    soon as these cowards saw that the Mantatees had retired, they
    rushed like hungry wolves to the spot where they had been
    encamped, and began to plunder and kill the wounded, also
    murdering the women and children with their spears and
    battle-axes.</p>

    <p>Fighting not being within the missionary's province, he
    refrained from firing a shot, though for safety he kept with
    the Griqua force. Seeing now the savage ferocity of the
    Bechwanas in killing the inoffensive women and children, he
    turned his attention to these objects of pity, who were fleeing
    in all directions. Galloping in among them, many of the
    Bechwanas <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"
    id="page68"></a>{68}</span> were deterred from their barbarous
    purpose, and the women, seeing that mercy was shown them, sat
    down, and baring their breasts, exclaimed, "I am a woman; I am
    a woman." The men seemed as though it was impossible to yield,
    and although often sorely wounded, they continued to throw
    their spears and war-axes at any one who approached.</p>

    <p>It was while carrying on his work of mercy among the wounded
    that Moffat nearly lost his life. He had got hemmed in between
    a rocky height and a body of the enemy. A narrow passage
    remained, through which he could escape at full gallop. Right
    in the middle of this passage there rose up before him a man
    who had been shot, but who had collected his strength, and,
    weapon in hand, was awaiting him. Just at that moment one of
    the Griquas, seeing the situation, fired. The ball whizzed
    past, close to Moffat. The aim had been a true one, and the way
    of escape was clear.</p>

    <p>This battle saved the mission. It did more than
    that&mdash;it saved the Mantatees themselves from terrible
    destruction. As a devastating host they would in all
    probability have advanced to the borders of the Colony, and
    being driven back, would have perished miserably, men, women,
    and children, either of starvation, or at the hands of those
    tribes whom they would have overcome in their advance, and
    through whose territories they must have passed in their
    retreat.</p>

    <p>After the battle was over, Mr. Melville and Robert Moffat
    collected many of the Mantatee women and children, who were
    taken to the missionary station. Alarm prevailed there for some
    days, it being feared that the Mantatees might make a descent
    upon the place after the Griquas had left. At one time the
    prospect was so ominous that the missionary band, with their
    wives and children, after burying their
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"
    id="page69"></a>{69}</span> property, left Lattakoo for a short
    time, and sought shelter at Griqua Town. The threatened attack
    not being made, and as it was found that the Mantatees had left
    the neighbourhood, the station was again occupied.</p>

    <p>The Bechwanas were deeply sensible of the interest the
    missionaries had shown in their welfare, at a time when they
    might with ease and little loss of property have retired in
    safety to the Colony, leaving them to be destroyed by the
    fierce invaders.</p>

    <p>For a long time past, it had been evident to Moffat that the
    site upon which they dwelt at Lattakoo was altogether
    unsuitable for missionary purposes. The great scarcity of
    water, especially in dry seasons, rendered any attempt at
    raising crops most difficult, and even water for drinking
    purposes could only be obtained in small quantity. Advantage
    was therefore taken of the present favourable impression, made
    upon the minds of Mothibi and his people, to obtain a site for
    a new station. A place eight miles distant, about three miles
    below the Kuruman fountain, where the river of that name had
    its source, was examined and found to offer better advantages
    for a missionary station than any other for hundreds of miles
    round. Arrangements were made with the Bechwana chiefs so that
    about two miles of the Kuruman valley should henceforth be the
    property of the London Missionary Society, proper remuneration
    being given as soon as Moffat returned from Cape Town, to which
    place he contemplated paying a visit shortly.</p>

    <p>This new station will be known in the further chronicle of
    events, by the name of Kuruman.</p>

    <p>At the beginning of 1824, the Moffats were in Cape Town.
    They had gone there to obtain supplies, to seek medical aid for
    Mrs. Moffat, who had suffered in health considerably, and to
    confer personally <span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"
    id="page70"></a>{70}</span> with Dr. Philip about the removal
    of the station. Mothibi having been anxious that his son,
    Peclu, should see the country of the white people, had sent
    him, accompanied by Taisho, one of the principal chiefs, to
    Cape Town with the missionaries.</p>

    <p>The young prince and his companion were astonished at what
    they saw. With difficulty they were persuaded to go along with
    Robert Moffat on board one of the ships in the bay. The
    enormous size of the hull, the height of the masts, the
    splendid cabin and the deep hold, were each and all objects of
    wonder; and when they saw a boy mount the rigging and ascend to
    the masthead, their astonishment was complete. Turning to the
    young prince, Taisho whispered, "Ah ga si khatla?" (Is it not
    an ape?) "Do these water-houses (ships) unyoke like waggon-oxen
    every night?" they inquired; and also; "Do they graze in the
    sea to keep them alive?" Being asked what they thought of a
    ship in full sail, which was then entering the harbour, they
    replied, "We have no thoughts here, we hope to think again when
    we get on shore."</p>

    <p>Upon the same day that the Moffats reached Cape Town, a ship
    arrived from England, bringing three new missionaries intended
    for the Bechwana station. Of these, however, one only and his
    wife, Mr. and Mrs. Hughes, were able to accompany the older
    missionary upon his return to his post.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Moffat's health being somewhat improved, the party left
    Cape Town, and after a tedious and monotonous journey of two
    months, Robert and Mary Moffat reached Lattakoo in safety. They
    had left Mr. and Mrs. Hughes at Griqua Town, where they were to
    remain for a season. Upon reaching home Mr. Hamilton was found
    pursuing his lonely labours with that quiet patience so
    characteristic of him.</p>

    <h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

    <h3>VISIT TO MAKABA.</h3>

    <p>Shortly after his return, and pending the final arrangements
    for the removal of the missionary station, it was considered
    advisable that Robert Moffat should pay his long promised visit
    to Makaba, the chief of the Bangwaketsi. He left on the 1st of
    July, 1824, and was accompanied by a large party of Griquas,
    who were going into that region to hunt elephants.</p>

    <p>Skirting the edge of the Kalahari desert for some time they
    afterwards deviated from their course through want of water,
    and visited Pitsana, where a great concourse of natives had
    gathered, consisting of the different sections of the Barolong
    tribe, who had been driven from their country the previous year
    during the invasion of the Mantatees. Thence they proceeded
    onward till they reached Kwakwe, the residence of Makaba and
    his people, and the metropolis of the Bangwaketsi. Here the
    missionary was most favourably received by the king, who
    remarked, with a laugh, "That he wondered they should trust
    themselves, unarmed, in the town of such a <i>villain</i> as he
    was reported to be."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"
    id="page72"></a>{72}</span></p>

    <p>He entertained Moffat and his party royally, declaring, "My
    friends, I am perfectly happy; my heart is whiter than milk,
    because you have visited me. To-day I am a great man. You are
    wise and bold to come and see with your own eyes, and laugh at
    the testimony of my enemies."</p>

    <p>Moffat tried on several occasions to converse with the chief
    and his people on Divine things, but apparently with little
    success. At length on the Sabbath he resolved to pay Makaba a
    formal visit, so as to obtain a hearing for the subject. He
    found the monarch seated among a large number of his principal
    men, all engaged either preparing skins, cutting them, sewing
    mantles, or telling news.</p>

    <div class="center">
        <img src="images/0179.jpg" alt="NATIVES SEWING"
        title="NATIVES SEWING" width="640" />

        <h4>NATIVES SEWING.</h4>
    </div>

    <p>Sitting down beside him, and amidst his nobles and
    counsellors, Moffat stated that his object was to tell
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"
    id="page73"></a>{73}</span> him news. The missionary spoke of
    God, of the Saviour, but his words fell upon deaf ears. One of
    the men sitting near, however, seemed struck with the character
    of the Redeemer, and especially with His miracles. On hearing
    that He had raised the dead, the man said, "What an excellent
    doctor He must have been to raise the dead." This led to a
    description of His power, and how that power would be exercised
    at the last day in the Resurrection. The ear of the monarch
    caught the sound of a resurrection from the dead, "What," he
    exclaimed in astonishment, "What are these words about? the
    dead, the dead arise!"</p>

    <p>"Yes, all the dead shall arise."</p>

    <p>"Will my father arise?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, your father will arise."</p>

    <p>"Will all the slain in battle arise?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"And will all that have been killed and devoured by lions,
    tigers, hyenas, and crocodiles again revive?"</p>

    <p>"Yes; and come to judgment."</p>

    <p>"And will those whose bodies have been left to waste and to
    wither on the desert plains and scattered to the winds again
    arise?" asked the king, with a kind of triumph, as though this
    time he had fixed the missionary.</p>

    <p>"Yes!" answered he, with emphasis; "not one will be left
    behind."</p>

    <p>After looking at his visitor for a few moments, Makaba
    turned to his people, saying in a stentorian voice: "Hark, ye
    wise men, whoever is among you, the wisest of past generations,
    did ever your ears hear such strange and unheard-of news?"</p>

    <p>Receiving an answer in the negative, he laid his hand upon
    Moffat's breast and said, "Father, I love
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"
    id="page74"></a>{74}</span> you much. Your visit and your
    presence have made my heart as white as milk. The words of your
    mouth are sweet as honey, but the words of a resurrection are
    too great to be heard. I do not wish to hear again about the
    dead rising! The dead cannot arise! The dead must not
    arise!"</p>

    <p>"Why," inquired the missionary, "can so great a man refuse
    knowledge and turn away from wisdom? Tell me, my friend, why I
    must not add to words and speak of a resurrection?"</p>

    <p>Raising and uncovering his arm which had been strong in
    battle, and shaking his hand as if quivering a spear, he
    replied, "I have slain my thousands, and shall they arise!"</p>

    <p>"Never before," adds Mr. Moffat in his <i>Missionary
    Labours</i>, "had the light of Divine revelation dawned upon
    his savage mind, and of course his conscience had never accused
    him, no, not for one of the thousands of deeds of rapine and
    murder which had marked his course through a long career."</p>

    <p>Starting homewards, the Griqua hunting party, for some
    altogether unexplained reason, announced their intention of
    returning with the missionary instead of remaining behind to
    hunt; a most providential circumstance, which in all
    probability saved the lives of Moffat and his followers and
    many more besides.</p>

    <p>A few hours after leaving Makaba, messengers met the
    returning company from Tauane, the chief of the Barolongs,
    asking the help of the missionary party as he was about to be
    attacked by the Mantatees. On reaching Pitsana they found that
    such was the case. The attack was made and repelled by the
    Griquas, about twenty in number, mounted and armed with guns;
    and thus the town was saved, the flight of its inhabitants into
    the Kalahari desert, there to perish
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"
    id="page75"></a>{75}</span> of hunger and thirst, prevented,
    and the safety of Robert Moffat and his companions secured.</p>

    <p>The time during which Moffat had been absent from Lattakoo,
    had been a most anxious one for his wife and those who remained
    at the station. A band of marauders had gathered in the Long
    Mountains, about forty miles to the westward, and after
    attacking some villages on the Kuruman, had threatened an
    attack on the Batlaping and the mission premises. The dreaded
    Mantatees were also reported to be in the neighbourhood. One
    night when Mary Moffat was alone with her little ones and the
    two Bushmen children, Mr. Hamilton and the assistants being
    away at the new station, a loud rap came at the door, and
    inquiring who was there, Mothibi himself replied. He brought
    word that the Mantatees were approaching.</p>

    <p>A hasty message was sent to Mr. Hamilton, who arrived about
    eight o'clock in the morning when preparations were made for
    flight. Messengers continued to arrive, each bringing tidings
    that caused fresh alarm, until about noon, when it was
    ascertained that the fierce and savage enemy had turned aside
    and directed their course to the Barolongs.</p>

    <p>The station was safe, but the loving heart of the
    missionary's wife was torn with anguish, as she foresaw that
    the dreaded Mantatees would be crossing her husband's path just
    at the time when he, almost alone, was returning on his
    homeward way.</p>

    <p>Prayer was the support of Mary Moffat under this terrible
    ordeal, and the way prayer was answered has been seen, in the
    unaccountable manner in which Berend Berend and his party of
    Griquas changed their minds and resolved upon returning with
    Robert Moffat, instead of remaining to hunt elephants in the
    country of the
    Bangwaketsi.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"
    id="page76"></a>{76}</span></p>

    <p>The remainder of the year 1824 witnessed bloodshed and
    strife all around. War among the Bechwanas, attacks by the
    marauders of the Long Mountains, commotions among the interior
    tribes: the land was deluged with blood; even the warlike
    Bangwaketsi were dispersed, and Makaba was killed. Once again
    the missionaries had to flee with their families to Griqua
    Town, leaving Mr. Hamilton, as he was without family in charge
    of the new station, with two horses ready for flight in case of
    danger.</p>

    <p>The end of the year found the Kuruman
    missionaries,&mdash;who now consisted of Robert and Mary
    Moffat, Mr. and Mrs. Hughes, and Mr. Hamilton,&mdash;with the
    exception of the last named, at Griqua Town.</p>

    <p>The new station at the Kuruman had been occupied shortly
    before the departure of the fugitives; and early in 1825,
    finding that the immediate danger had passed, the Moffats,
    accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Hughes, rejoined Mr. Hamilton. Two
    events of a distressing character to the Batlaping and their
    missionaries occurred about this time. The first was the
    passage of two terrible hail-storms over a portion of the
    country, destroying the crops, killing lambs, and stripping the
    bark from trees. The second was the death of the young prince,
    Peclu, who had an excellent disposition, was comparatively
    enlightened, and whose influence the missionaries expected
    would have been most salutary among his countrymen.</p>

    <p>This sorrowful event, combined with a further attack upon
    the Batlaping by the marauders, determined Mothibi and his
    people to leave their present place of settlement and remove to
    the eastward. For a considerable time, however, they remained
    in an unsettled state, suffering from attacks, and leading a
    vagrant life.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"
    id="page77"></a>{77}</span> The work of laying out the new
    station was proceeded with. Three temporary dwellings had
    already been erected, consisting of a wooden framework, filled
    up with reeds, and plastered within and without; the
    foundations of more permanent dwellings had also been laid. Mr.
    Hughes, who had been to Cape Town for supplies, returned,
    accompanied by a mason named Millen and a few Hottentot
    assistants from Bethelsdorp. The company at the station was a
    large one, and to provide them with food was a work of
    difficulty.</p>

    <p>The Kuruman fountain, the source of the Kuruman river,
    issues from caverns in a little hill. It was the purpose of the
    missionaries to lead the water from the river to irrigate their
    gardens. For this purpose a trench was cut two miles in length.
    This was a work of great labour and was attended by
    considerable danger. It was found necessary that the men when
    working should have their guns with them, in case of being
    surprised by the robbers who roved about. Moffat says, "it was
    dug in troublous times."</p>

    <p>Sickness and death entered the missionary dwellings. An
    infant son was born to the Moffats, and five days after called
    away. Mr. Hughes was laid low through a severe cold, and
    brought to the gates of death. When all hope seemed to have
    vanished he began to amend, though his health was not restored
    until he and Mrs. Hughes made a journey to the Cape. In 1827 he
    left Kuruman and removed to the Griqua Mission. The mother of
    Mary Moffat died in October, 1825, but the news did not reach
    her daughter in Africa until April, 1826.</p>

    <p>Referring to this time Robert Moffat says: "Our situation
    during the infancy of the new station, I shall not attempt to
    describe. Some of our newly arrived
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"
    id="page78"></a>{78}</span> assistants, finding themselves in a
    country where the restraints of law were unknown, and not being
    under the influence of religion, would not submit to the
    privations which we patiently endured, but murmured
    exceedingly. Armed robbers were continually making inroads,
    threatening death and extirpation. We were compelled to work
    daily at every species of labour, most of which was very heavy,
    under a burning sun, and in a dry climate, where only one
    shower had fallen during the preceding twelve months. These are
    only imperfect samples of our engagements for several years at
    the new station, while at the same time, the language, which
    was entirely oral, had to be acquired."</p>

    <p>Notwithstanding all the impediments to such an enterprise,
    Robert Moffat had made some progress towards establishing a
    literature in the native, or Sechwana tongue. A spelling-book,
    catechism, and some small portions of Scripture had been
    prepared, and sent to the Cape to be printed, in 1825. Through
    a mistake, these were unfortunately sent on to England, causing
    much disappointment and delay.</p>

    <p>Things settled down somewhat in 1826. The discontented
    Hottentots returned to the Colony, leaving the missionaries and
    Mr. Millen to carry on the work of laying out the station,
    erecting the buildings, and the other manual labour connected
    with the undertaking, assisted only by such poor help as they
    could get from the Bechwanas.</p>

    <p>The native population at the station had been much reduced.
    Such of the Batlaping as had not moved away, had settled down
    about the Kuruman valley. They did not oppose the Gospel, but
    they appeared quite indifferent to it.</p>

    <p>For several years the country had been parched
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"
    id="page79"></a>{79}</span> through drought, but early in 1826
    rain fell plentifully. The earth was soon covered with verdure,
    but the bright prospects of abundance were quickly cut off.
    Swarms of locusts infested the land, and vegetation was
    entirely destroyed. This led to great scarcity, and although
    the natives caught and ate the locusts, hunger and suffering
    prevailed. The missionaries' cattle could not be let out of
    sight, or they were instantly stolen. One day two noted fellows
    from the mountains pounced down upon a man who had charge of
    some oxen. They murdered the man and made off with an ox.</p>

    <p>To become proficient in the Sechwana language was the
    earnest purpose of Robert Moffat. At the end of the year 1826,
    having moved into his new dwelling, built of stone, and the
    state of the country being somewhat more tranquil, he left his
    home and family, to sojourn for a time among the Barolongs, so
    that he might live exclusively with the natives and attend to
    their speech.</p>

    <p>He made the journey by ox-waggon, and was accompanied by the
    waggon-driver, a boy, and two Barolongs who were journeying to
    the same place as himself. The dangers attending these
    journeyings from tribe to tribe were by no means imaginary, the
    following, related in Moffat's own words, serving as an
    illustration of some of the perils often encountered:</p>

    <p>"The two Barolongs had brought a young cow with them, and
    though I recommended their making her fast as well as the oxen,
    they humorously replied that she was too wise to leave the
    waggon, even though a lion should be scented. We took a little
    supper, which was followed by our evening hymn and prayer. I
    had retired only a few minutes to my waggon to prepare for the
    night, when the whole of the oxen
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"
    id="page80"></a>{80}</span> started to their feet. A lion had
    seized the cow only a few steps from their tails, and dragged
    it to the distance of thirty or forty yards, where we
    distinctly heard it tearing the animal and breaking its bones,
    while its bellowings were most pitiful. When these were over, I
    seized my gun, but as it was too dark to see half the distance,
    I aimed at the spot where the devouring jaws of the lion were
    heard. I fired again and again, to which he replied with
    tremendous roars, at the same time making a rush towards the
    waggon so as exceedingly to terrify the oxen. The two Barolongs
    engaged to take firebrands and throw them at him so as to
    afford me a degree of light that I might take aim. They had
    scarcely discharged them from their hands when the flames went
    out, and the enraged animal rushed towards them with such
    swiftness, that I had barely time to turn the gun and fire
    between the men and the lion. The men darted through some thorn
    bushes with countenances indicative of the utmost terror. It
    was now the opinion of all that we had better let him alone if
    he did not molest us.</p>

    <p>"Having but a scanty supply of wood to keep up a fire, one
    man crept among the bushes on one side of the pool, while I
    proceeded for the same purpose on the other side. I had not
    gone far, when looking upward to the edge of the small basin, I
    discerned between me and the sky four animals, whose attention
    appeared to be directed to me by the noise I made in breaking a
    dry stick. On closer inspection I found that the large round,
    hairy-headed visitors were lions, and retreated on my hands and
    feet towards the other side of the pool, when coming to my
    waggon-driver, I found him looking with no little alarm in an
    opposite direction, and with good reason, as no fewer
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page81"
    id="page81"></a>{81}</span> than two lions with a cub were
    eyeing us both, apparently as uncertain about us as we were
    distrustful of them. We thankfully decamped to the waggon and
    sat down to keep alive our scanty fire, while we listened to
    the lion tearing and devouring his prey. When any of the other
    hungry lions dared to approach he would pursue them for some
    paces with a horrible howl, which made our poor oxen tremble,
    and produced anything but agreeable sensations to ourselves. We
    had reason for alarm, lest any of the six lions we saw,
    fearless of our small fire, might rush in among us."</p>

        <h4>BAROLONG WOMEN.</h4>
    </div>

    <p>From these dangers Moffat was mercifully preserved
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"
    id="page82"></a>{82}</span> and after journeying for six days
    he reached the village of a young chief named Bogachu. At this
    place, and at one about twenty miles distant, he lived a
    semi-savage life for ten weeks. To use a common expression he
    "made himself at home" among them. They were kind and appeared
    delighted with his company, especially as when food run scarce,
    he could take his gun and shoot a rhinoceros or some other
    animal, when a night of feasting and talking would follow.</p>

    <p>Every opportunity was embraced by the missionary of
    imparting Christian instruction to these people; their supreme
    idea of happiness, however, seemed able to rise no higher than
    having plenty of meat. Asking a man, who seemed more grave than
    the rest, what was the finest sight he could desire, he
    replied, "A great fire covered with pots full of meat," adding,
    "How ugly the fire looks without a pot"</p>

    <p>The object of the journey was fully gained; henceforth
    Robert Moffat needed no interpreter; he could now speak and
    preach to the people in their own tongue. He found all well on
    reaching home and prepared to settle down with a feeling of
    ability to the work of translation.</p>

    <p>The prospects of the mission at this time began to brighten.
    Several thousands of the natives had gathered on the opposite
    side of the valley, near the mission station. They were
    becoming more settled in their minds, and would collect in the
    different divisions of the town when the missionaries visited
    them; the public attendance at the regular religious services
    daily increased, and the school was better attended. No visible
    signs of an inward change in the natives could yet be seen, but
    Moffat and his fellow-workers felt certain that this was not
    far off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"
    id="page83"></a>{83}</span></p>

    <p>War again intervened and darkened the brightening prospects.
    Once more the missionaries, after prayerful consideration, felt
    it necessary to flee to Griqua Town, suffering much loss of
    time and of property. Happily the storm passed over, and, on
    returning to the Kuruman, they found their houses, and such
    property as they had left behind, in good order, a proof of the
    influence they were gaining over the once thievish Bechwanas.
    Half the oxen and nearly all the cows belonging to the
    missionaries were, however, dead, no milk could be obtained,
    and, worse than these evils, the people had fled, leaving their
    native houses but heaps of ashes.</p>

    <p>Sorrowfully these servants of God resolved once more to
    resume their labours. A few poor natives had remained at the
    station, whose numbers were being increased by others who
    arrived from day to day.</p>

    <p>At this trying time the hearts of Robert Moffat and his
    companions were cheered by the arrival of the Rev. Robert
    Miles, the Society's superintendent, who, having made himself
    conversant with the affairs of the station, suggested the great
    importance of preparing something like hymns in the native
    language. By the continued singing of these, he stated the
    great truths of salvation would become imperceptibly written on
    the minds of the people.</p>

    <p>The suggestion so kindly made was acted upon, and Moffat
    prepared the first hymn in the language. The spelling-books
    also arrived, which enabled the missionaries to open a school
    in the Sechwana tongue. Mr. Miles returned, and the stated
    labours of the mission were carried forward. With few
    interruptions they had been continued for ten years without
    fruit. But the dawn of a new era seemed now ready to rise above
    the horizon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"
    id="page84"></a>{84}</span></p>

    <p>Yet again, however, was their faith to be sorely tried by
    the terrible scourge&mdash;war. The desperadoes consisted this
    time of a party advancing from the Orange River, among whom
    were some Griquas. The suspense and anxiety were great, but
    recourse was had to prayer. On this occasion the missionaries
    determined to remain at their post. A first attack was repulsed
    through the intrepidity of an escaped slave named Aaron
    Josephs, and a peaceful interval intervened of about two
    months, when a second attack on the mission premises was
    threatened. By Moffat's directions, the heights at the back of
    the station were crowded with men, to give the appearance of a
    large defending force, though probably not a dozen guns could
    have been mustered among them. The assailants seeing the
    preparations for defence, drew up at some distance, and, after
    a short delay, sent forward two messengers with a flag of
    truce. Moffat went out to meet them, and learned that a
    renegade Christian Griqua named Jantye Goeman wished to see him
    at their camp.</p>

    <p>A meeting was arranged half way between the station and the
    camp, and Jantye, who was ashamed to let the missionary see his
    face, as he had known him at Griqua Town, tried to lay all the
    blame upon another renegade, a Coranna chief named Paul, who
    had, in days gone by, entertained Robert Moffat and visited his
    dwelling.</p>

    <p>At this moment a waggon was seen approaching, and fearing it
    might contain some one from Griqua Town, and seeing that a
    hostile movement was made towards it, Moffat turned to Jantye
    and said, "I shall not see your face till the waggon and its
    owners are safe on the station." He instantly ran off and
    brought the waggon through, when it was found to contain
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"
    id="page85"></a>{85}</span> the Wesleyan missionaries Mr. and
    Mrs. Archbell from Platberg.</p>

    <p>At last, after much hesitation, Paul himself came near. He
    could not look at Moffat, and kept his hat drawn down over his
    eyes. He told the missionary that he himself need have no fear,
    but that revenge should be had upon the Batlaping who were at
    Kuruman.</p>

    <p>"I shall have their blood and their cattle too," said Paul,
    as his eyes glared with fury.</p>

    <p>Long and patiently Moffat argued with him, showing him the
    enormity of his crimes. At last the victory was won. No shot
    was fired, and both the station and the Batlaping were saved.
    Turning to his men, and referring to some of the missionary's
    cattle which had been stolen, he cried, "Bring back those cows
    and sheep we took this morning."</p>

    <p>It was done. Then he said, "I am going. There are the things
    of your people. Will Mynheer not shake hands with me for
    once?"</p>

    <p>"Of course I will," said Moffat, "but let me see your
    face."</p>

    <p>"That I will not, indeed," he replied, "I do not want to die
    yet. I can see your face through my hat."</p>

    <p>The rude hand of war was henceforth stayed, and the land had
    peace for half-a-century, during which time great and happy
    changes took place at the Kuruman station.</p>

    <h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER
    VII.</h2>

    <h3>THE AWAKENING.</h3>

    <p>The long delayed, and fervently prayed for time had come at
    last. For ten weary years these earnest and faithful
    missionaries had laboured without seeing any results. Now their
    hearts were to rejoice as they should witness the work of the
    Holy Spirit, and see those over whom they had so long mourned,
    brought to the Saviour, and out of heathen darkness into Gospel
    light.</p>

    <p>"The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the
    sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither
    it goeth;" so was it with the awakening among the Bechwanas at
    the Kuruman. There seemed no apparent cause for the intensity
    of feeling that was now displayed by these people. Men, who had
    scorned the idea of shedding a tear, wept as their hearts were
    melted. The chapel became a place of weeping, and some, after
    gazing intently upon the preacher, fell down in hysterics. The
    little chapel became too small to hold the numbers who flocked
    to it, and with the voluntary aid of Aaron Josephs a new
    building, fifty-one feet long by sixteen wide, with clay walls
    and thatched roof, was erected
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"
    id="page87"></a>{87}</span> to serve as a school-house and
    place of worship, until the large stone church, which was to
    form the most prominent feature of the station, should be
    completed.</p>

    <p>This temporary church was opened in May, 1829, and in the
    following month, after very careful examination, six candidates
    for baptism were selected from among the inquirers. Speaking of
    these converts Robert Moffat said, "It was truly gratifying to
    observe the simplicity of their faith, implicitly relying on
    the atonement of Christ, of which they appeared to have a very
    clear conception, considering the previous darkness of their
    minds on such subjects."</p>

    <p>They were baptised on the first Sabbath in July, a large
    number of spectators from the neighbouring towns, and a party
    of Griquas, being present. In the evening the missionaries, the
    new disciples, and a Griqua, twelve in all, sat down to the
    Lord's table. In connection with this event an interesting
    anecdote is related showing the strong faith of Mary
    Moffat!</p>

    <p>On one occasion, some time before this event, when all
    seemed dark, her friend Mrs. Greaves of Sheffield had written
    to Mary Moffat kindly inquiring if there was anything of use
    which she could send. The reply returned was, "Send us a
    communion service, we shall want it some day." Communication
    between the Kuruman and England was tardy then, and before an
    answer came to her letter the darkness increased, and the
    Bechwanas seemed as far from salvation as ever. On the day
    preceding the reception of the first converts into the Kuruman
    Church, a box arrived from England, which had been twelve
    months on the road, and in it were found the communion vessels
    that Mary Moffat had asked for more than two years before.</p>

    <p>Great as was the change, the missionaries rejoiced
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"
    id="page88"></a>{88}</span> with trembling. They knew that
    there were great prejudices to be overcome, and that the
    relation in which the Christians stood to their heathen
    neighbours would expose their faith to trial. But they prayed
    and believed that He who had begun the good work would carry it
    on.</p>

    <p>The change of heart speedily produced a change in dress and
    habits. Those who had been baptised had previously procured
    decent raiment, and prepared it for the occasion with Mrs.
    Moffat's assistance. A sewing-school had hitherto been uncalled
    for, the women's work having been that of building houses,
    raising fences, and tilling the ground; now Mrs. Moffat met
    those who desired to learn as often as her strength would
    permit, and soon she had a motley group of pupils, very few of
    the whole party possessing either a frock or a gown. The
    scarcity of materials was a serious impediment to progress, but
    ornaments, which before the natives had held in high repute,
    were now parted with to purchase the skins of animals, which
    being prepared almost as soft as cloth were made into jackets,
    trousers, and gowns. When a visit was paid by a trader, British
    manufactures were eagerly bought.</p>

    <p>In the progress of improvement some amusing incidents
    occurred. A man might be seen in a jacket with one sleeve,
    because the other was not yet finished; or others went about in
    duffel jackets with sleeves of cotton of various colours; gowns
    like Joseph's coat were worn, and dresses of such fantastic
    shapes, that to tell the fashion of the same would have been a
    puzzle.</p>

    <p>To Mrs. Moffat general application was made both by males
    and females. One brought skins to be cut into dresses, another
    wanted a jacket, a third a pattern,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"
    id="page89"></a>{89}</span> while a fourth brought his jacket
    sewed upside down, and asked why it did not fit. Fat, which
    before they always considered was to be rubbed on their bodies
    or deposited in their stomachs, they now found useful in making
    candles to give light in their dwellings.</p>

    <p>The prospects of the missionaries continued cheering, and
    the increased anxiety for instruction and growth in knowledge
    among the candidates greatly strengthened their hands. "I seek
    Jesus," one would say; a second, "I am feeling after God, I
    have been wandering, unconscious of my danger, among beasts of
    prey; the day has dawned, I see my danger." The missionaries
    were cautious men, and were slow to receive members into their
    little church, but the evidence was complete that numbers were
    saved.</p>

    <p>The happy death of a native woman about this time afforded
    them much encouragement. When she knew her end was near, she
    said to those around, "I am going to die. Weep not because I am
    going to leave you, but weep for your sins and your souls. With
    me all is well, for do not suppose that I die like a beast, or
    that I shall sleep for ever in the grave. No! Jesus has died
    for my sins; He has said he will save me, I am going to be with
    Him." Thus one who a few months before was as ignorant as the
    cattle, departed with the full assurance of an eternal life
    beyond the grave.</p>

    <p>Rumours had for some time past reached the Kuruman station
    of a strong and warlike people who dwelt to the eastward, spoke
    another language, and were strangers to the Bechwanas. In the
    latter portion of 1829, two envoys were specially sent from
    Moselekatse, the king of this people, the Matabele, to the
    mission station at Kuruman, to learn about the manners and
    teaching of the white men
    there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"
    id="page90"></a>{90}</span></p>

    <p>These envoys, who were two of the king's head men, were
    entertained, the principal objects, industries, and methods of
    living were pointed out to them; but their greatest wonder was
    excited when they beheld the public worship in the mission
    chapel. They listened to the hymns, and to the address, part of
    which only they understood, and were much surprised when they
    heard that the hymns were not war songs.</p>

    <p>When the time came for the ambassadors to depart, they
    begged Robert Moffat to accompany them, as they were afraid of
    the Bechwana tribes through whom they would have to pass on
    their return journey. This circumstance led to his visiting the
    warlike Moselekatse, over whom he obtained a marvellous
    influence.</p>

    <p>The details of the journey we must pass over. As they
    advanced they saw evidences on every hand of the terrible
    Mantatees, and the still more terrible Matabele. In places,
    where populous towns and villages had been, nothing remained
    but dilapidated walls and heaps of stones, mingled with human
    skulls. The country had become the abode of reptiles and beasts
    of prey; the inhabitants having perished beneath the spears and
    clubs of their savage enemies.</p>

    <p>The reception accorded Robert Moffat by Moselekatse may best
    be described in the missionary's own words:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"We proceeded directly to the town, and on riding into the
    centre of the large fold, we were rather taken by surprise to
    find it lined by eight hundred warriors, besides two hundred
    who were concealed on each side of the entrance, as if in
    ambush. We were beckoned to dismount, which we did, holding our
    horses' bridles in our hands. The warriors at the gate
    instantly rushed in with hideous yells, and leaping from the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"
    id="page91"></a>{91}</span> earth with a kind of kilt round
    their bodies, hanging like loose tails, and their large
    shields, frightened our horses. They then joined the circle,
    falling into rank with as much order as if they had been
    accustomed to European tactics. Here we stood, surrounded by
    warriors, whose kilts were of ape skins, and their legs and
    arms adorned with the hair and tails of oxen, their shields
    reaching to their chins and their heads adorned with
    feathers.</p>

    <p>"A profound silence followed for some ten minutes; then all
    commenced a war-song, stamping their feet in time with the
    music. No one approached, though every eye was fixed upon us.
    Then all was silent, and Moselekatse marched out from behind
    the lines with an interpreter, and with attendants following,
    bearing meat, beer, and other food. He gave us a hearty
    salutation and seemed overjoyed."</p>

    <p>The waggons were objects that struck the dusky monarch with
    awe. He examined them minutely, especially the wheels; one
    point remained a mystery, how the iron tire surrounding the
    wheel came to be in one piece without end or joint. Umbate, the
    head-man, who had visited the mission station, explained what
    he had seen in the smith's shop there. "My eyes," said he, "saw
    that very hand," pointing to Moffat's hand, "cut these bars of
    iron, take a piece off one end, and then join them as you now
    see them." "Does he give medicine to the iron?" the monarch
    inquired. "No," said Umbate, "nothing is used but fire, a
    hammer, and a chisel."</p>

    <p>This powerful chieftain was an absolute despot ruling over a
    tribe of fierce warriors, who knew no will but his. He was the
    terror of all the surrounding country, his smile was life, his
    frown scattered horror and death. Yet even in his savage breast
    there were <span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"
    id="page92"></a>{92}</span> chords that could be touched by
    kindness, and Moffat received many tokens of his friendship
    during the eight days that he stayed in his town.</p>

    <p>During one of their first interviews the monarch, laying his
    hand upon Moffats shoulder, said, "My heart is all white as
    milk; I am still wondering at the love of a stranger who never
    saw me. You have fed me, you have protected me, you have
    carried me in your arms. I live to-day by you, a stranger."</p>

    <p>Upon Moffat replying that he was unaware of having rendered
    him any such service, he said, pointing to his two ambassadors:
    "These are great men; Umbate is my right hand. When I sent them
    from my presence to see the land of the white men, I sent my
    ears, my eyes, my mouth; what they heard I heard, what they saw
    I saw, and what they said it was Moselekatse who said it. You
    fed them and clothed them, and when they were to be slain you
    were their shield. You did it unto me. You did it unto
    Moselekatse, the son of Machobane."</p>

    <p>Moffat explained to this African king the objects of the
    missionary, and pressed upon him the truths of the Gospel. On
    one occasion the king came attended by a party of his warriors,
    who remained at a short distance dancing and singing. "Their
    yells and shouts," says Moffat, "their fantastic leaps and
    distorted gestures, would have impressed a stranger with the
    idea that they were more like a company of fiends than men." As
    he looked upon the scene, his mind was occupied in
    contemplating the miseries of the savage state. He spoke to the
    king on man's ruin and man's redemption. "Why," said the
    monarch, "are you so earnest that I abandon all war, and do not
    kill men?" "Look on the human bones which lie scattered over
    your dominions," was the missionary's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"
    id="page93"></a>{93}</span> answer. "They speak in awful
    language, and to me they say, 'Whosoever sheddeth man's blood,
    by man also will his blood be shed.'" Moffat also spoke of the
    Resurrection, a startling subject for a savage and murderer
    like Moselekatse.</p>

    <p>The kindness of the king extended to the missionary's return
    journey. Food in abundance was given to him, and a number of
    warriors attended his waggon as a guard against lions on the
    way. After an absence of two months he reached home in safety,
    where he found all well, and the Divine blessing still resting
    upon the Mission. Copious showers had fallen, and the fields
    and gardens teemed with plenty. The converts and many others,
    leaving their old traditions as to horticulture, imitated the
    example of the missionaries in leading out water to their
    gardens, and raised crops, not only of their native grain,
    pumpkins, kidney-beans, and water-melons, but also vegetables,
    such as the missionaries had introduced, maize, wheat, barley,
    peas, potatoes, carrots, onions, and tobacco&mdash;this latter
    they had formerly purchased from the Bahurutsi, but now it
    became a profitable article of traffic. They also planted fruit
    trees.</p>

    <p>As an illustration of their zeal, which was not always
    according to knowledge, the following may be given. The course
    of the missionary's water-trench along the side of a hill,
    appeared as if it ascended, therefore several of the natives
    set to work in good earnest, and cut courses leading directly
    up hill, hoping the water would one day follow.</p>

    <p>The spiritual affairs of the station kept pace with the
    external improvements. The temporary chapel continued to be
    well filled, a growing seriousness was observable among the
    people, progress was made in reading, and there was every
    reason for encourage<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"
    id="page94"></a>{94}</span> ment. Early In 1830, after the
    second mission-house had been finished and occupied by Mr.
    Hamilton, the foundation of a new and substantial stone church
    was laid. Circumstances, however, and especially the difficulty
    of procuring suitable timber for the roof delayed its
    completion for several years.</p>

    <p>The work of translation had been kept steadily in view. In
    June, 1830, Robert Moffat had finished the translation into
    Sechwana, of the Gospel of Luke, and a long projected journey
    to the coast was undertaken by him and his wife. The journey
    had for its objects, to put the two elder children to school,
    to get the translation of Luke printed, and to collect
    subscriptions among friends in the Colony towards the building
    of the new place of worship.</p>

    <p>At Philippolis, on their journey, they met with the French
    missionaries Rolland and Lemue, of the Paris Protestant
    Missionary Society, and also with Mr. and Mrs. Baillie, who had
    been appointed by the London Missionary Society to the Kururnan
    Mission. At Graham's Town, Mary Moffat remained behind to place
    the children at the Wesleyan school near there, and Robert
    visited several of the mission stations in Kafirland, and
    afterwards some of those within the Colony, finally reaching
    Cape Town in October, 1830.</p>

    <p>At that early day printing in Cape Town was in its infancy.
    It was therefore found necessary to make application to the
    Governor to allow the Gospel of Luke In Sechwana to be printed
    at the Government Printing Office. The request was cheerfully
    acceded to, but compositors there were none to undertake the
    work. This difficulty, combined with the promise of an
    excellent printing press, which Dr. Philip had in his
    possession for the Kuruman Mission,
    induced<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"
    id="page95"></a>{95}</span> Moffat to learn printing. He was
    joined by Mr. Edwards, who was now appointed to the Kuruman
    station, and under the kind superintendence of the assistant in
    charge of the office, they soon not only completed the work
    they had in hand, but acquired a fair knowledge of the art of
    printing. Besides the Gospel of Luke, a small hymn-book was
    printed in the Sechwana language.</p>

    <p>A violent attack of bilious fever followed these labours,
    which had been carried on in the hottest season of the year,
    and when the time came for Robert Moffat to leave Cape Town he
    had to be carried on board the ship on a mattress. The sea
    passage to Algoa Bay, however, although a rough one, tended
    greatly to his restoration to health.</p>

    <p>Sickness among their oxen, and the birth of a daughter, whom
    they named Elizabeth, detained the Moffats some time at
    Bethelsdorp, on their return journey; from which place,
    accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Edwards, they went forward to the
    Kuruman, where they arrived in June, 1831. They carried with
    them the edition of the Gospel of Luke, a hymn-book printed in
    the language of the people, a printing-press, type, paper, and
    ink, besides liberal subscriptions from friends in the Colony
    towards the erection of the mission church.</p>

    <p>Great was the astonishment of the natives when they saw the
    printing-press at work. Lessons, spelling-books and catechisms
    were prepared for the schools. To see a white sheet of paper
    disappear for a moment and then emerge covered with letters was
    beyond their comprehension. After a few noisy exclamations one
    obtained a sheet, with which he bounded through the village,
    showing it to all he met, and saying it had been made in a
    moment with a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"
    id="page96"></a>{96}</span> round black hammer (a printer's
    ball) and a shake of the arm.</p>

    <p>A large box containing materials for clothing from a friend
    in Manchester, Miss Lees, had also formed part of the baggage
    brought from the Cape. Materials being now at hand, and Mrs.
    Edwards and Mrs. Baillie co-operating, a sewing-school on a
    much larger scale was established, to the great comfort and
    improvement of the natives.</p>

    <p>The congregation continued to increase and new members were
    added to the church, but sorrows tempered the joy of this happy
    time. Small-pox entered the country, and many of the
    inhabitants died; with them passed away one of the daughters of
    Robert and Mary Moffat. Towards the end of 1832 the labourers
    at Kuruman were cheered by a visit from Dr. Philip, who
    arranged that the two French missionaries, Rolland and Lemue,
    should commence a mission station at Motito, a place nearly
    forty miles distant, in a north-easterly direction.</p>

    <p>In January, 1835, a scientific expedition under Dr. Andrew
    Smith, arrived at Moffat's station. This visit appeared as
    though ordered by an over-ruling Providence for the especial
    benefit of himself and his devoted wife. It found them in sore
    trouble, and it brought help and a friend in time of need. Mr.
    Edwards was away and Robert had been overworked. When Dr. Smith
    arrived, he found him suffering from an attack of intermittent
    fever, and hastened to render aid. Under the Doctor's skilful
    treatment he speedily recovered. On the 10th of March another
    son was added to the Moffat family, and shortly afterwards Mary
    was suddenly taken seriously ill, and became so weak, that for
    many days her recovery seemed hopeless. The Doctor was at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page97"
    id="page97"></a>{97}</span> that time away surveying, but upon
    receiving information of the position of affairs at Kuruman, he
    immediately hastened to render all the assistance in his
    power.</p>

    <p>Speaking of this friend, raised up so unexpectedly, Robert
    Moffat writes in his book: "His tender sympathy and unremitting
    attention in that trying season, during which all hope of her
    recovery had fled, can never be erased from our grateful
    recollection, for in the midst of his active and laborious
    engagements at the head of the expedition, he watched for
    several successive nights, with fraternal sympathy, what
    appeared to be the dying pillow of my beloved partner, nor did
    he leave before she was out of danger."</p>

    <p>A life-long friendship was cherished for the one who had
    come to them in their sore need, and who was always most
    gratefully remembered by the African missionary and his
    exemplary wife.</p>

    <p>Shortly after these events, at the request of Dr. Smith,
    Robert Moffat accompanied the expedition on a visit to
    Moselekatse and the Matabele country. Moselekatse was delighted
    to see his missionary friend again. The scientific expedition
    had permission to travel through any part of the monarch's
    territories, but Moffat, the king kept as his guest. Together
    they visited, in the missionary's waggon, several of the
    Matabele towns, and many conversations were held, in which the
    importance of religion, and the evil effects of the king's
    policy were faithfully pointed out.</p>

    <p>By this journey, which occupied three months, a way was
    paved for some American missionaries to reside with
    Moselekatse, and the country was surveyed to find timber
    suitable for the roof of the
    new<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98"
    id="page98"></a>{98}</span> Kuruman church. This timber was
    afterwards collected by Messrs. Hamilton and Edwards&mdash;the
    wood-cutters having to travel to a distance of two hundred and
    fifty miles&mdash;and fashioned into the roof of the church;
    which stands at this day a monument of the united labours of
    Hamilton, Moffat, and Edwards; and a wonder to beholders as to
    how such an achievement could have been performed with the
    slender means then at hand.</p>

        <h4>MOFFAT PREACHING AT MOSHEU'S VILLAGE.</h4>
    </div>

    <p>Upon Moffat's return home again, his wife, by Dr. Smith's
    orders, left for the Cape to recruit her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page99"
    id="page99"></a>{99}</span> strength; and Robert Moffat went
    itinerating among the scattered Bechwanas. A most interesting
    time was spent at a village, one hundred and fifty miles from
    Kuruman, where a chief named Mosheu and his people resided.
    Three times did the missionary preach to them on the first day,
    besides answering the questions of all who gathered round. Many
    were most anxious to learn to read, and such spelling-books as
    Moffat had with him were distributed among them.</p>

    <p>Some of the head men thought they would like to try, and
    requested Moffat to teach them. A large sheet alphabet, torn at
    one corner, was found, and laid on the ground. All knelt in a
    circle round it, some of course viewing the letters upside
    down. "I commenced pointing with a stick," says he, "and when I
    pronounced one letter, all hallooed to some purpose. When I
    remarked that perhaps we might manage with somewhat less noise,
    one replied, 'that he was sure the louder he roared, the sooner
    would his tongue get accustomed to the seeds' as he called the
    letters."</p>

    <p>Somewhat later, a party of young folks seized hold of the
    missionary, with the request, "Oh, teach us the A B C with
    music." Dragged and pushed, he entered one of the largest
    native houses, which was instantly crowded. The tune of "Auld
    Lang Syne" was pitched to A B C, and soon the strains were
    echoed to the farthest corner of the village. Between two and
    three o'clock on the following morning, Moffat got permission
    to retire to rest; his slumbers were, however, disturbed by the
    assiduity of the sable choristers; and on awaking after a brief
    repose, his ears were greeted on all sides by the familiar
    notes of the Scotch air.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"
    id="page100"></a>{100}</span></p>

    <p>Very pleasing progress was made by these people in Christian
    knowledge. Mosheu brought his daughter to Mrs. Moffat for
    instruction, and his brother took his son to Mr. Lemue at
    Motito for the same purpose.</p>

    <p>The mission at the Kuruman continued to prosper, both at the
    home and the out-stations. Numbers of Bechwanas were added to
    the church, both at Kuruman and Griqua Town. Under Mr. Edwards'
    superintendence the readers largely increased, and the Infant
    School, commenced and carried on by Mrs. Edwards, with the
    assistance of a native girl, was highly satisfactory.
    Civilisation advanced, some of the natives purchasing waggons,
    and using oxen for labour which formerly had been performed by
    women. Clothing was in such demand, that a merchant named Hume,
    an honourable trader in whom the missionaries had confidence,
    built a house, and settled at the station. The new church,
    after much labour, was opened in November, 1838, on which
    occasion between eight and nine hundred persons attended the
    service; and on the following Sabbath, one hundred and fifty
    members united in celebrating the Lord's Supper.</p>

    <p>Persevering Christian love, combined with strong faith, much
    prayer, and untiring labour, had changed the barren wilderness
    into a fruitful land.</p>

    <h3>VISIT TO ENGLAND.</h3>

    <p>The work of Bible translation had been steadily pressed
    forward; all available time having been devoted by Robert
    Moffat to that undertaking. By the end of 1838, the whole of
    the New Testament had been rendered into the native tongue, and
    a journey was made by the Moffats to Cape Town, to recruit
    their health, and to get the Sechwana New Testament printed;
    the task being too heavy for the mission press. Cape Town was
    but little better off than the Kuruman for accomplishing a work
    of this magnitude, and it speedily became apparent that the
    printing would have to be undertaken in England.</p>

    <p>Twenty-two years had passed away since the youthful
    missionary stood upon the deck of the <i>Alacrity</i>, and bade
    farewell to the land of his birth. During that time he had
    never allowed his interest in the affairs of his native country
    to grow cold. Letters and newspapers had been eagerly welcomed,
    and the memory of friends in the far distant isle had been most
    keenly cherished, both by him and his Mary. Now once more they
    were to tread upon its
    well-<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"
    id="page102"></a>{102}</span> loved shores, and to tell to its
    people the story of God's work among the savage tribes of South
    Africa.</p>

    <p>There were no floating "Castles"<a name="FNanchor_A_1"
    id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1"
    class="fnanchor">[A]</a> at that time, making the journey in
    twenty days, and a passage had to be taken in a small ship
    homeward-bound from China, having troops on board. Measles
    raged at the Cape, and sickness was on board ship. Between the
    two the Moffats had much to endure, and the vessel had not left
    Table Bay when another daughter was born to add to their joy
    and anxiety. Three days' after his sister came, dear
    six-year-old Jamie, lying beside his prostrate mother in her
    cot, was called to the Better Land, with the words, "Oh, that
    will be joyful, when we meet to part no more," upon his dying
    lips.</p>

    <div class="footnote">

        <i>Garth Castle</i>, &amp;c., which make the voyage to the
        Cape in twenty days.</p>
    </div>

    <p>On the 6th June, 1839, the ship anchored off Cowes, and a
    few days later reached London. The reception of Robert Moffat
    was most enthusiastic, and so great was the demand for his
    presence at public meetings, that it was with the utmost
    difficulty he procured liberty to visit his own friends.</p>

    <p>Twenty years had made great changes in the homes at both
    Dukinfield and Inverkeithing. Mary Moffat's aged father was
    living, but her mother and a brother had been called away,
    another brother was in America, and a third was a missionary in
    Madras. Robert's parents were still living, but a brother and
    two sisters had passed away. Many friends, whose kind and
    generous thoughtfulness had often cheered the heart of the
    faithful missionary and his faithful wife in their voluntary
    exile, now gathered around them, among whom were Mrs. Greaves
    of Sheffield, the donor of the Communion Service, and Miss Lees
    of Manchester.</p>

    <p>Of the events connected with this visit to England,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"
    id="page103"></a>{103}</span> want of space precludes us from
    giving details. A great wave of missionary enthusiasm at that
    time swept over the country, and Moffat found himself hurried
    from town to town with but scant opportunities for rest. In
    May, 1840, he preached the Anniversary Sermon for the London
    Missionary Society, and, at their Annual Meeting, Exeter Hall
    was packed so densely that after making his speech in the large
    upper hall, Moffat had to give it again in the smaller hall
    below.</p>

    <p>An anecdote related in the course of his speech at the Bible
    Society's May Meeting shows the value set by a native woman
    upon a single Gospel in the native tongue. "She was a Matabele
    captive," said Moffat. "Once, while visiting the sick, as I
    entered her premises, I found her sitting weeping, with a
    portion of the Word of God in her hand. I said, 'My child what
    is the cause of your sorrow? Is the baby still unwell?' 'No,'
    she replied, 'my baby is well,' 'Your mother-in-law?' I
    inquired. 'No, no,' she said, 'it is my own dear mother, who
    bore me.' Here she again gave vent to her grief, and, holding
    out the Gospel of Luke, in a hand wet with tears, she said, 'My
    mother will never see this word; she will never hear this good
    news! Oh, my mother and my friends, they live in heathen
    darkness; and shall they die without seeing the light which has
    shone on me, and without tasting that love which I have
    tasted!' Raising her eyes to heaven she sighed a prayer, and I
    heard the words again, 'My mother, my mother!'"</p>

    <p>His hope when he landed had been to get the printing of the
    Sechwana New Testament speedily accomplished, and to return to
    South Africa before winter; but it was not until January, 1843,
    that he was able once again to sail for
    Africa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"
    id="page104"></a>{104}</span></p>

    <p>In 1840 two new missionaries were set apart for the Bechwana
    mission&mdash;- William Ross and David Livingstone. With them
    Robert Moffat was able to send five hundred copies of the
    Sechwana New Testament.</p>

    <p>As the sheets were passing through the press, it was
    suggested to him that the Psalms would be a valuable addition
    to the work. With his characteristic energy he immediately
    commenced the task, and, a few months after the sailing of Ross
    and Livingstone, he had the joy of sending to Africa over two
    thousand copies of the New Testament, with which the Psalms had
    been bound up. By the end of 1843 six thousand copies had been
    sent out. A revision of the book of Scripture Lessons was also
    undertaken and carried through the press. A demand was made
    upon him to write a book, in response to which he prepared his
    well known work, "Missionary Labours and Scenes in South
    Africa," which was published in 1842, and met with great
    success.</p>

    <p>At length the time drew near when once more Robert and Mary
    Moffat should cross the sea to their beloved home at Kuruman.
    Valedictory services of a most enthusiastic character were held
    in Scotland, Newcastle, Manchester, and London. At Edinburgh a
    copy of the "Encyclopaedia Britannica" was presented to Robert
    Moffat, and at Newcastle a set of scientific instruments was
    given him. A great impetus was imparted to missionary work
    abroad through these and preceding meetings, during his sojourn
    in England, and when on the 30th of January, 1843, he and his
    wife embarked at Gravesend, accompanied by two new missionaries
    for the Bechwana field, they carried with them the esteem of a
    wide circle of friends, and had the fervent prayers of many
    offered up on their
    behalf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"
    id="page105"></a>{105}</span></p>

    <p>On the 10th of April they landed at Cape Town, and six weeks
    later embarked in a small coasting vessel for Algoa Bay. At
    Bethelsdorp, a village a few miles beyond Port Elizabeth, they
    rejoined Messrs. Ashton and Inglis, who with their wives had
    gone on before by steamer; but here they were detained for
    several months, waiting for a vessel to arrive from England
    which had on board a large quantity of baggage for the
    missionaries and their work.</p>

        title="CAPE TOWN" width="600" />

        <h4>CAPE TOWN.</h4>
    </div>

    <p>At last the start was made, the long train of ox waggons
    wended their way, the Orange River was crossed, this time on a
    pont or floating bridge, and at the Vaal River, one hundred and
    fifty miles distant from Kuruman, the missionary party were met
    by<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"
    id="page106"></a>{106}</span> David Livingstone, who had ridden
    forth to bid them welcome.</p>

    <p>From this point onwards friends both white and black
    emulated each other in testifying their gladness at their
    friend's return, until as the Moffats drew near to Kuruman
    their progress became like a royal one. At last between two and
    three o'clock on the 10th of December, 1843, they sat down once
    again in their own home, amongst those for whom they had toiled
    so zealously, and over whom their hearts yearned with a holy
    love. The delight of the natives at having their missionary and
    his wife among them again was unbounded. In a letter published
    in the <i>Missionary Magazine</i>, October, 1844, Moffat thus
    writes, giving an account of their reception:&mdash;"Many were
    the hearty welcomes we received, all appearing emulous to
    testify their joy. Old and young, even the little children,
    would shake hands with us. Some gave vent to their joy with an
    air of heathen wildness, and some in silent floods of tears;
    while others, whose hearts had sickened with deferred hope,
    would ask again and again, 'Do our eyes indeed behold you?'
    Thus we found ourselves once more among a people who loved us,
    and who had longed for our return."</p>

    <p>The mission having been largely reinforced, it was arranged
    that Mr, and Mrs. Ross should go to Taung, about one hundred
    miles east of Kuruman, where a portion of the Bechwana tribe
    had settled under Mahura, a brother of Mothibi; while Edwards
    and Livingstone were to commence work among the Bakhatla, two
    hundred miles to the north-east. Inglis was to go to the same
    neighbourhood; thus the regular missionary staff of the Kuruman
    station comprised after their departure, the venerable
    Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"
    id="page107"></a>{107}</span> Hamilton, who had seen the
    commencement of the Bechwana Mission in 1816, Mr. and Mrs.
    Ashton, and the Moffats.</p>

    <p>The place to which Edwards and Livingstone had gone was a
    large native town near to the haunts of lions. These greatly
    harassed the cattle and deprived the missionaries of sleep. One
    day a hunt was arranged. Livingstone joined the party, was
    attacked by the lion, and was only rescued with a broken and
    mangled arm by the bravery and devotion of his native servant,
    Mebalwe, who himself got severely bitten.</p>

        <h4>LIVINGSTONE ATTACKED BY A LION.</h4>
    </div>

    <p>During his recovery from this injury Livingstone visited the
    Kuruman, and there won the heart of Moffat's eldest daughter,
    her mother's namesake, who soon afterwards exchanged the name
    of Mary Moffat for that of Mary Livingstone. In due course she
    accompanied her husband to Chonwane where for a time he was
    located with Sechele, the chief of the Bakwena.</p>

    <p>The life of the missionaries at the Kuruman was a, busy one.
    All were fully employed. Moffat's principal work was
    translation, and in this his colleague Ashton afforded him much
    critical assistance, besides relieving him almost entirely of
    the duties of the printing office. But other work had to be
    undertaken. The natives needed much help and guidance;
    dwelling-houses had to be enlarged and new schoolrooms built,
    and, as there were no funds for the payment of artisans, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"
    id="page108"></a>{108}</span> missionaries had to put their own
    hands to the work; besides which, as money was not forthcoming
    to meet the cost of the new schoolrooms, a kind of amateur
    store was opened by the missionaries' wives for the sale of
    clothing to the natives.</p>

    <p>The Rev. J. J. Freeman who visited Africa a few years later,
    in 1849, gives us a picture of the Kuruman station as he saw
    it. "It wears," says he, "a very pleasing appearance. The
    mission premises, with the walled gardens opposite, form a
    street wide and long. The chapel is a substantial and
    well-looking building of stone. By the side of it stands Mr.
    Moffat's house, simple yet commodious. In a cottage hard by,
    the venerable Hamilton was passing his declining days,
    extremely feeble, but solaced by the motherly care of his
    colleague's wife. The gardens were well stocked with fruit and
    vegetables, requiring much water, but easily getting it from
    the 'fountain.' On the Sunday morning the chapel bell rang for
    early service. Breakfasting at seven, all were ready for the
    schools at half-past eight. The infants were taught by Miss
    Moffat (their daughter Ann, afterwards Mrs. Frdoux) in their
    school-house; more advanced classes were grouped in the open
    air, or collected in the adjacent buildings. Before ten the
    work of separate teaching ceased, and young and old assembled
    for public worship. A sanctuary, spacious and lofty, and airy
    withal, was comfortably filled with men, women, and children,
    for the most part decently dressed."</p>

    <div class="center">
        <img src="images/0188.jpg" alt="KURUMAN" title="KURUMAN"
        width="640" />
   </div>

    <p>This description may be supplemented by that of a scene of
    frequent occurrence, given in "Robert and Mary Moffat" by their
    son Mr. John A. Moffat. He says: "The public services were, of
    course, in the Sechwana language. Once a week the missionary
    families met for an English devotional meeting. It
    <!--page 109 contains photo--><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"
       id="page110"></a>{110}</span> was also a sort of custom that
       as the sun went down there should be a short truce from work
       every evening. A certain eminence at the back of the station
       became, by common consent, the meeting-place. There the
       missionary fathers of the hamlet would be found, each
       sitting on his accustomed stone. Before them lay the broad
       valley, once a reedy morass, now reclaimed and partitioned
       out into garden lands; its margin fringed with long
       water-courses, overhung with grey willows and the dark green
       syringa. On the low ground bordering the valley stood the
       church, with its attendant mission-houses and schools, and
       on the heights were perched the native villages, for the
       most part composed of round, conical huts, not unlike
       corn-stacks at a distance, with some more ambitious attempts
       at house-building in the shape of semi-European cottages.
       Eastward stretched a grassy plain, bounded by the horizon,
       and westward a similar plain, across which about five miles
       distant, was a range of low hills. Down to the right, in a
       bushy dell, was the little burying-ground, marked by a few
       trees."</p>

    <p>In 1845, Robert Moffat narrowly escaped an accident that
    would have involved most serious consequences. He was
    superintending the erection of a new corn-mill, and whilst
    seeing to its being properly started, incautiously stretched
    his arm over two cog-wheels. In an instant the shirt sleeve was
    caught and drawn in, and with it the arm. Fortunately the mill
    was stopped in time, but an ugly wound, six inches in length,
    with torn edges, bore witness to the danger escaped. This wound
    laid him aside for many weeks, but finally he recovered from
    the effects of the accident.</p>

    <p>For the next four or five years things pursued an
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"
    id="page111"></a>{111}</span> even course at the Kuruman. In
    1846, Mary Moffat started on a journey to visit the
    Livingstones at Chonwane. She availed herself of the escort of
    a native hunting party, and took her three younger children
    with her. She passed through the usual dangers of such a
    journey, as the following extract from a letter written to her
    husband will show:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I am very glad of Boey's company.... I should indeed have
    felt very solitary with my lone waggon with ignorant people,
    but he is so completely at home in this field that one feels
    quite easy. We do not stop at nights by the waters, but come to
    them at mid-day, and then leave about three or four o'clock. We
    cannot but be constantly on the outlook for lions, as we come
    on their spoor every day, and the people sometimes hear them
    roar. Just before outspanning to-day, Boey, being on horseback
    looking for water, met with a majestic one, which stood still
    and looked at him. He tried to frighten the lion, but he stood
    his ground, when Boey thought it was time to send a ball into
    him, which broke his leg, by which means he is disabled from
    paying us a visit."</p>

    <p>Early in 1847 a general meeting of those engaged in the
    Bechwana mission was held at Lekatlong (near what are now the
    Diamond Fields). On his way homewards from this meeting Moffat
    visited some of the Batlaping villages along the Kolong River.
    A striking advance had taken place of late years, and a severe
    contest was going on between heathenism and Christianity. A
    little company of believers had gathered in each place, and
    were ministered to by native teachers, who had spent a few
    months in training at Kuruman.</p>

    <p>In the same year Mary Moffat left for the Cape to make
    arrangements for educating her younger
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"
    id="page112"></a>{112}</span> children. As Robert could not
    leave his work she journeyed alone, having as attendants four
    Bechwana men and a maid. These partings wrung the mother's
    heart. The time spent on the road was precious, and although it
    extended to two months, seemed all too short. She felt that
    never again would she have her young children about her. The
    son, John, was placed at school in Cape Town for a time, and
    the two daughters were sent under the care of a worthy minister
    to England. Of the parting with these her darlings Mary Moffat
    wrote:&mdash;"Though my heart was heaving with anguish I
    joyfully and thankfully acceded forthwith (<i>i.e.</i>, to the
    offer of the Rev. J. Crombie Brown to take the children), and
    set about preparations in good earnest. This was about the end
    of January. On the tenth of February they embarked, and after
    stopping the night on board I tore myself from my darlings to
    return to my desolate lodgings to contemplate my solitary
    journey, and to go to my husband and home childless." Of her it
    may be said, <i>She left all and followed Him</i>!</p>

    <p>In 1848 the book of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes had been
    finished and Isaiah begun. In 1849 "Pilgrim's Progress" was
    added to the Sechwana literature, and the work of translation
    steadily progressed. "Line upon Line" had also been rendered
    into the native tongue by Mr. Ashton.</p>

    <p>But while all was peaceful and in a measure prosperous at
    the Kuruman, clouds were gathering to the eastward, which were
    destined eventually to throw a dark shadow over the whole
    Bechwana Mission. The encroachments of the Boers upon the
    natives led to much bloodshed, and to the dispersion of several
    native tribes, with the consequent abandonment of mission-work
    among them. One of the early sufferers
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"
    id="page113"></a>{113}</span> was Moselekatse, who, having been
    attacked in 1837, had retired to a place far away to the
    north-east, and for some years nothing was heard of him, except
    by vague rumour; indeed his very existence was a matter of
    doubt.</p>

    <p>Livingstone had settled with Sechele at Kolobeng, which
    place he used simply as a base of operations for visiting the
    eastern tribes, and prosecuting missionary work among them.
    Much good was done, and the Scriptures in Sechwana, as far as
    issued, were circulated among the people. But the Boers
    advanced, the natives were dispossessed of their lands, and
    missionaries were expelled from their regions. Finding that all
    hope of carrying on the work in this neighbourhood was over,
    Livingstone turned his eyes northward, and commenced that
    series of explorations which absorbed the remainder of his
    life. Sechele retired to a mountain fastness, named
    Lithubaruba, away to the north-west.</p>

    <p>As time passed onward, Robert Moffat felt more than ever the
    importance of completing the work he had undertaken&mdash;the
    translation of the entire Bible into Sechwana. Every minute
    that could be devoted to the task was eagerly embraced, his
    labours often extending far into the night. Numerous
    interruptions made the work more difficult. "Many, many are the
    times I have sat down and got my thoughts somewhat in order,"
    he writes, "with pen in hand to write a verse, the correct
    rendering of which I had just arrived at, after wading through
    other translations and lexicons, when one enters my study with
    some complaint he has to make, or counsel to ask, or medical
    advice and medicine to boot, a tooth to be extracted, a
    subscription to the auxiliary to be measured or counted; or one
    calls to say he is going
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page114"
    id="page114"></a>{114}</span> to the Colony, and wishes
    something like a passport; anon strangers from other towns, and
    visitors from the interior arrive, who all seem to claim a
    right to my attentions."</p>

    <p>This incessant application was making inroads upon his
    health, and the strong powerful frame and iron constitution of
    the Scotch missionary began to show signs that could not be
    neglected. A peculiar affection of the head troubled
    him&mdash;a constant roaring noise like the falling of a
    cataract, and a buzzing as of a boiling up of waters. It never
    ceased day and night, and he lost much sleep in consequence of
    it. His only relief seemed to be in study and preaching, when
    the malady was not noticed; but immediately these occupations
    were over it was found to be there, and reasserted itself in
    full force.</p>

    <p>In 1851 the rebellion of the Kat River Hottentots occurred,
    which, for a long time, brought obloquy upon the missionaries
    of South Africa and the Mission cause.</p>

    <p>In 1852 Mr. Hamilton was gathered to his rest, after having
    been the faithful coadjutor of Robert Moffat, and a missionary
    at the Kuruman for thirty-four years; the next year tidings
    reached Mary Moffat that her beloved father had ended his
    pilgrimage at the ripe age of ninety years.</p>

    <p>A short time previous a letter had been received from the
    Directors of the London Missionary Society, urging Robert
    Moffat to take sick leave and visit the Cape, or to return to
    England, but, as rest and change were absolutely essential,
    Moffat determined to find the needed relaxation in visiting his
    old native friend, Moselekatse. He was also in doubt as to the
    fate of his son-in-law, Livingstone, who had started long
    before for the tribes on the
    Zambesi.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115"
    id="page115"></a>{115}</span></p>

    <p>Carrying supplies for that missionary, in hope of being able
    to succour him, in May, 1854, Moffat once again bade his
    faithful partner farewell, and started for a journey to a
    comparatively unknown country, seven or eight hundred miles
    away. The son of Mr. Edwards, the missionary who for some time
    had laboured with Moffat at Kuruman, and a young man named
    James Chapman accompanied him, for purposes of trade. After
    journeying for several days through a desert country, they
    reached Sechele's mountain fastness. Moffat found that chief in
    great difficulties, but still holding to the faith into which
    he had been baptised by Livingstone. One hundred and twenty
    more miles of desert travelling brought the party to Shoshong,
    the residence of another chief and his tribe. Thence after
    groping their way for eighteen days in a region new to them,
    without guides, they reached a village containing some natives
    who were subject to the Matabele king.</p>

    <p>For some days Moffat and his companions were not allowed to
    advance. The Induna in charge of the outpost was afraid of a
    mistake, but at last a message came that they were to proceed,
    and finally they drew near to the royal abode. The chief was
    filled with joy at meeting his old friend "Moshete." An account
    of the interview is described in Moffat's journal, from which
    we extract the following:&mdash;"On turning round, there he
    sat&mdash;how changed! The vigorous, active, and nimble chief
    of the Matabele, now aged, sitting on a skin, lame in his feet,
    unable to walk, or even to stand. I entered, he grasped my
    hand, gave one earnest look, and drew his mantle over his face.
    It would have been an awful sight for his people to see the
    hero of a hundred fights wipe from his eyes the falling tears.
    He spoke not, except <span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"
    id="page116"></a>{116}</span> to pronounce my name, Moshete,
    again and again. He looked at me again, his hand still holding
    mine, and he again covered his face. My heart yearned with
    compassion for his soul. Drawing a little nearer to the
    outside, so as to be within sight of Mokumbate, his venerable
    counsellor, he poured out his joy to him."</p>

    <p>The old chief was suffering with dropsy, but under Moffat's
    medical care he recovered, and was soon able to walk about
    again. The advice which had been given to him by his missionary
    friend during their previous intercourse, had not been wholly
    lost, the officers who attended him, as well as those of lower
    grades, stating that the rigour of his government had since
    that time been greatly modified.</p>

    <p>Moffat stayed with Moselekatse nearly three months. After
    much persuasion, permission was given him to preach the Gospel
    to the Matabele people, a privilege hitherto always denied. On
    the 24th of September, 1854, these people received, for the
    first time, instruction in the subjects of creation,
    providence, death, redemption, and immortality.</p>

    <p>It was Moffat's purpose to journey forward beyond the
    Matabele to the Makololo tribe, to leave supplies at their town
    of Linyanti, so that Livingstone might obtain them if he
    returned safely from St. Paul de Loanda, on the west coast.
    Moselekatse would not accede to the idea of him going alone,
    and finally the king himself determined to accompany him. The
    Makololo and Matabele were, however, like many other of the
    native tribes, hostile to each other. With the bags, boxes,
    &amp;c., on the heads of some of the men best acquainted with
    the country, the party set out, but after travelling to the
    farthest outpost of the Marabele, the king declared it was
    impossible for the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"
    id="page117"></a>{117}</span> waggons to proceed. At Moffat's
    earnest request, he sent forward a party of his men with the
    supplies, which in due course reached the Makololo, who placed
    them on an island, built a roof over them, and there they were
    found in safety by Livingstone when he returned some months
    afterwards from the west coast.</p>

    <p>Towards the end of October, Moffat bade farewell to the
    Matabele king. Moselekatse pressed him to prolong his stay,
    pleading that he had not seen enough of him, and that he had
    not yet shown him sufficient kindness. "Kindness!" replied
    Moffat, "you have overwhelmed me with kindness, and I shall now
    return with a heart overflowing with thanks." Leaving the
    monarch a supply of suitable medicines to keep his system in
    tolerable order, and admonishing him to give up beer drinking,
    and to receive any Christian teacher who might come as he had
    received him, the missionary took his departure. The long
    return journey was accomplished without any remarkable event,
    and in due course Moffat reached his home again in safety.</p>

    <p>By this journey his health was much improved, his
    intercourse and friendship with the people of the interior were
    cemented and extended, and he looked forward with hopeful
    assurance to the early advancement of Christianity to those
    distant regions.</p>

    <h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

    <h3>THE SECHWANA BIBLE.</h3>

    <p>The great task was at length accomplished; the work of
    nearly thirty years brought to a close. The Word of God in the
    language of the Bechwana people, in all its glorious
    completeness and power, was now in their hands.</p>

    <p>To Robert Moffat the labour had been of a herculean
    character. He had spared himself no labour or drudgery which
    its prosecution involved. To accomplish it he had left his home
    and lived a semi-savage life for nearly three months, that he
    might perfect himself in the language. Without any special
    training for the important undertaking, and under the greatest
    disadvantages, he had not only acquired the language, but
    reduced it to its elements, and then presented it in a
    synthetic and grammatical form. Beyond that his earnest desire
    had been to render the whole Bible into the native tongue.</p>

    <p>As age increased, the importance of finishing the work
    became more and more apparent, till even a minute spent in
    anything but purely mission-work, or his translation duties,
    seemed as wasted time. Writing when the end was near, he said:
    "When I take up a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"
    id="page119"></a>{119}</span> newspaper, it is only to glance
    at it with a feeling like that of committing sacrilege. I have
    sometimes been arrested with something interesting, and have
    read it with ten or more strokes in the minute added to my
    pulse, from the anxiety caused by the conviction that I am
    spending precious time apart from its paramount object, while I
    feel perfectly composed over anything which I am satisfied has
    a direct bearing on the true object of the missionary."</p>

    <p>But the work was now accomplished, the last sheet had been
    passed for press, the last verse of the Old Testament
    completed, and now his mind, which had been for so many years
    strained under the weighty responsibility of translating the
    Word of God, was free. Of his feelings on this occasion he made
    mention in a speech delivered some years later at Port
    Elizabeth, on the occasion of his final departure from South
    Africa. We quote from the Chronicle of the London Missionary
    Society for August, 1870.</p>

    <p>"At last," he said, referring to the commencement of the
    undertaking, "I came to the resolution that if no one else
    would do it, I would undertake it myself. I entered heartily
    upon the work. For many years I had no leisure, every spare
    moment being devoted to translating, and was a stranger even in
    my own family. There was labour every day, for back, for hands,
    for head. This was especially the case during the time Mr.
    Edwards was there; our condition was almost one of slavery.
    Still the work advanced, and at last I had the satisfaction of
    completing the New Testament. Of this 6000 copies were printed
    by the Home Society.</p>

    <p>"When Dr. Livingstone came, he urged me to begin at once
    with the Old Testament. That was a most stupendous work. Before
    commencing it I passed <span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"
    id="page120"></a>{120}</span> many sleepless nights. It was the
    wish of all that I should undertake it. I did so, and went on
    with the work from time to time, as I had leisure, daily and
    nightly. I stuck to it till I had got as far as the end of
    Kings, when I became completely done up. The Directors were
    afraid that I was killing myself. I was advised to go home, to
    leave the work, but I decided otherwise. I determined to look
    up Moselekatse, and went off with a son of brother Edwards. By
    the time I had found Moselekatse, I had got all right again. I
    came back and resumed my work, and continued it till its
    completion. I cannot describe to you the feelings of that
    time&mdash;of the writing of the last verse. I could hardly
    believe that I was in the world, so difficult was it for me to
    realise the fact that my labour of years was completed. Whether
    it was from weakness or overstrained mental exertion, I cannot
    tell; but a feeling came over me that I would die, and I felt
    perfectly resigned. To overcome this I went back again to my
    manuscript still to be printed, read it over, and re-examined
    it, till at length I got back again to my right mind. This was
    the most remarkable time of my life, a period I shall never
    forget. My feelings found vent by my falling upon my knees and
    thanking God for His grace and goodness in giving me strength
    to accomplish my task. My work was thus accomplished, and now I
    see the Word of God read by thousands of Bechwanas in their
    native tongue."</p>

    <p>An incident related in his speech at the Bible Society's
    Annual Meeting upon the occasion of his first visit to England
    in 1839, shows the importance to the natives of having the
    Bible in their own tongue. Speaking of his translation of the
    Gospel of Luke, he alluded to the state of the unconverted
    heathen, and the contrast manifested by the Christian
    converts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121"
    id="page121"></a>{121}</span> When the heathen saw the converts
    reading the Book which had produced this change, they inquired
    if they (the converts) talked to it. "No," answered they, "it
    talks to us; for it is the Word of God." "What then," replied
    the strangers, "does it <i>speak</i>?" "Yes," said the
    Christians, "it speaks to the heart!" This explanation was
    true, and was often illustrated in fact; for among those to
    whom the same Book was read by others, it became proverbial to
    say that the readers were "turning their hearts inside
    out!"</p>

    <p>In 1854 Mary Moffat paid another visit to the Colony, and
    was in consequence away from home when Robert returned from his
    journey to Moselekatse. Tidings reached him about that time of
    the death of his mother, the one who first instilled into his
    breast an enthusiasm for the missionary calling. She died as
    she had lived, a godly, consistent woman, and was called to the
    heavenly city at the age of eighty-four.</p>

    <p>In 1856 Dr. Livingstone, after his unparalleled walk from
    Loanda, on the west coast, to Quillimane, on the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"
    id="page122"></a>{122}</span> east&mdash;from the shores of the
    Atlantic to those of the Indian Ocean&mdash;visited England.
    His visit, and the description he gave of the country and
    natives, rekindled missionary enthusiasm, a special interest
    being taken in the Matabele and Makololo tribes. The London
    Missionary Society resolved to establish missions among them.
    As the locality where the Makololo dwelt was in the midst of a
    marshy network of rivers, it was considered as a necessary
    condition of commencing the proposed missionary work that they
    should remove to a spot on the north bank of the Zambesi,
    opposite to where the Matabele dwelt on the south bank. The two
    tribes were, however, hostile to each other; and, to overcome
    this hostility, it was determined to simultaneously establish
    missions among both tribes. With this object in mind the
    Directors wrote to Robert Moffat, proposing that he should go
    for a twelvemonth to the Matabele, taking two younger men with
    him, and plant a mission among this people.</p>

    <p>This letter reached him just as he had completed the
    translation and printing of the Old Testament; and,
    notwithstanding that he was then sixty-two years of age, and
    had already been forty-one years hard at work for the Society,
    he determined to go. He felt, however, that it was necessary
    for him to start at once, and prepare the minds of Moselekatse
    and his people for the coming among them of missionaries. Thus
    it came about that once again Robert Moffat quitted Kuruman,
    and started forward for the long and trying journey, through
    the African desert, to visit his old friend, and obtain his
    consent to the settlement of missionaries among his people.</p>

    <p>Visiting the chief Sechele on the way, he pursued his course
    until he at length reached the headquarters
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"
    id="page123"></a>{123}</span> of Moselekatse. The king was not
    very enthusiastic about receiving missionaries for himself and
    his people. He was somewhat suspicious; and his former
    experience with the American missionaries at Mosega had been
    rather unfortunate, the Boers having attacked the Matabele,
    and, after pillaging the mission station, carried the
    missionaries away with them. However, he would receive the
    new-comers,&mdash;but his friend Moshete must come also. "I
    love you," said he, "you are my father. These new men I do not
    know them. All men are not alike."</p>

    <p>This African monarch had sufficient knowledge to know that,
    if the doctrines of the Bible prevailed among his tribe, his
    claims to divine honour would for ever cease. His warriors used
    to pay him homage as follows: "O Pezoolu, the king of kings,
    king of the heavens, who would not fear before the son of
    Machobane (his father's name), mighty in battle?" and with
    other similar marks of adulation. He also had a shrewd
    suspicion that the opening of the country for white men to come
    and settle, would mean, eventually, the downfall of the power
    of himself and his people? but in his friend Ramary, or
    Moshete, he had implicit confidence.</p>

    <p>As an instance of the power which Moffat had obtained over
    this despotic chief of a fierce African tribe, it may be
    related that he prevailed upon Moselekatse to grant deliverance
    to the heir to the chieftainship of the Bamangwato, a large
    tribe living at Shoshong, to the north-east of Sechele's
    people. It was after a long conversation that the thing was
    settled. Macheng, the heir, who had been detained captive for
    sixteen years, was called, and Moselekatse addressing him said:
    "Macheng, man of Moffat, go with your father. We have arranged
    respecting you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"
    id="page124"></a>{124}</span> Moffat will take you back to
    Sechele. That is my wish as well as his, that you should be in
    the first instance restored to the chief from whom you were
    taken in war. When captured you were a child; I have reared you
    to be a man."</p>

    <p>The effect of this deliverance on the neighbouring tribes
    was very great. It occurred while Moffat was with Moselekatse,
    arranging for the settlement of the new missionaries. When he
    and his charge arrived at Sechele's town, on his way home, he
    was met by Sechele and the other chiefs of his tribe, who
    marched on in front, and led them to a kind of natural
    amphitheatre, where at least ten thousand of the people, in all
    their equipments of war, were assembled. Sechele commanded
    silence, and introduced the business of the meeting. Speaker
    followed speaker, in enthusiastic language giving expression to
    the joy they felt at seeing the chief of the Bamangwato return
    from captivity. In the course of his speech one said as
    follows:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Ye tribes, ye children of the ancients, this day is a day
    of marvel.... Now I begin to perceive that those who preach are
    verily true. If Moffat were not of God, he would not have
    espoused the cause of Sechele, in receiving his words, and
    delivering Macheng from the dwelling-place of the beasts of
    prey, to which we Bechwanas dared not approach. There are those
    who contend that there is nothing in religion. Let such to-day
    throw away their unbelief. If Moffat were not such a man, he
    would not have done what he has done, in bringing him who was
    lost&mdash;him who was dead&mdash;from the strong bondage of
    the mighty. Moselekatse is a lion; he conquered nations, he
    robbed the strong ones, he bereaved mothers, he took away the
    son of Kheri. We talk of love. What
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"
    id="page125"></a>{125}</span> is love? We hear of the love of
    God. Is it not through the love of God that Macheng is among us
    to-day? A stranger, one of a nation&mdash;who of you knows its
    distance from us?&mdash;he makes himself one of us, enters the
    lion's abode, and brings out to us our own blood."</p>

    <p>On reaching home, from his visit to the Matabele, Moffat
    found that the Livingstones were starting for the Zambesi, and
    were to call at the Cape on their way; also that a large party
    of new missionaries had been appointed to commence the new
    interior missions. The Moffats at once started for the Cape,
    and there met Dr. and Mrs. Livingstone and their companions.
    Once more the mother and daughter embraced each other, and as
    the latter had suffered much on the voyage, it was arranged
    that she should accompany the missionary party, and travel
    overland to the Zambesi.</p>

    <p>At Cape Town Moffat also had the pleasure of welcoming his
    own son, the Rev. John Moffat, who was to proceed to the
    Matabele as a missionary, paid for out of Dr. Livingstone's
    private resources. Sir George Grey, Her Majesty's High
    Commissioner, warmly encouraged the proposed plans for
    extending Christianity and commerce to the interior tribes, and
    arranged with Robert Moffat for establishing a postal
    communication with the Zambesi <i>vi</i> Kuruman.</p>

    <p>All arrangements having been completed the missionaries left
    Cape Town on their way to Kuruman, from whence they were to
    proceed to their respective stations, with the Makololo and the
    Matabele. Delays, however, intervened; the Boers had attacked
    some of the Batlapings, and threatened to attack the Kuruman
    station; the difficulties of the road also
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"
    id="page126"></a>{126}</span> prevented some of the party
    arriving with the others. At last, however, the way was made
    clear, the opposition of the Boers to the advance of the party
    was, through the intervention of Sir George Grey, overcome, and
    on the 7th of July, 1859, the first division started for their
    far distant destination. This division comprised Mr. Helmore, a
    veteran who for many years had been stationed at Lekatlong,
    with his wife and four children, and Mr. and Mrs. Price. There
    was also a native teacher from Lekatlong, named Tabe, who
    determined to accompany his old missionary, and the usual staff
    of native attendants. These were all to proceed to the
    Makololo. The situation was a grave one. The end of the journey
    was a point a thousand miles farther into the interior than any
    of them had ever been, except two native servants, who had
    accompanied Livingstone on a previous occasion. But they went
    forward in faith not knowing what lay before them, but trusting
    all into the hands of Him, without whose knowledge not even a
    sparrow falls to the ground.</p>

    <p>A week later Mr. Thomas and John Moffat with their wives
    left; they were speedily followed by Robert Moffat and Mr.
    Sykes. At Sechele's town the two portions of this latter
    division were united, and thence they journeyed onwards towards
    the Matabele. Disease broke out among some of their oxen, and,
    on reaching the first outpost of Moselekatse's people, a
    messenger was sent forward to the king explaining the state of
    affairs, and proposing that the oxen of the missionaries should
    be left in quarantine, and that Moselekatse should supply his
    own oxen to bring the party to headquarters. This message was
    sent so as to avoid connecting the advent of the Gospel among
    these people with that of a pestilence among their
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page127"
    id="page127"></a>{127}</span> herds of cattle; which would
    inevitably have been the case had the diseased oxen proceeded
    onwards and infected those belonging to the Matabele.</p>

    <p>An answer was returned to the effect that the party were to
    proceed, and that though the epidemic took effect, they should
    be held guiltless.</p>

    <p>Moffat despatched a second messenger, to say that he had
    heard the king's words, and in a couple of days would leave;
    but that he begged the monarch to reflect on the consequences
    of the epidemic being introduced among his tens of thousands of
    cattle, and to believe that the mission party felt the most
    extreme anxiety upon the subject.</p>

    <p>They then proceeded forward very slowly for two or three
    days, when they were met by another messenger, who stated that
    Moselekatse was gratified with the anxiety expressed for him
    and his; and that now, fully convinced of his danger, he
    desired that all their oxen should return, and that warriors
    were advancing to drag the mission waggons to headquarters.</p>

    <p>Every one started with surprise at the strange idea, but
    soon the warriors came, shields, and spears, and all, also a
    number of oxen to be slaughtered for food. After some war
    evolutions, the warriors took the place of the draught oxen,
    and a start was made. There was many "a strong pull, a long
    pull, and a pull all together," as the waggons rolled onward;
    but after ten days' hard struggle and slow progress, it became
    evident that the men sent were unequal to the task, and the
    monarch, who for some unknown reason had kept his oxen back,
    sent them at last to bring the waggons to his camp.</p>

    <p>Moselekatse received his old friend with his usual
    cordiality; but it soon became evident that something
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page128"
    id="page128"></a>{128}</span> was wrong. All kinds of evasions
    and delays met the request for a spot of ground on which to
    found a mission station; days, weeks, and months passed, during
    which the missionaries suffered great hardships; and at last
    the chief broke up his camp and left them, without oxen to draw
    their waggons, saying that he would send people to guide them
    to the spot where they were to settle, and at which place he
    would join them later on.</p>

    <p>His conduct seemed strange, and Moffat began to suspect that
    he had repented of giving his permission for the missionaries
    to settle with him. This proved to be the case; the Boer
    inroads, following as they had done, in several cases, the
    advent of the missionaries, made him suspicious, and the fears
    of himself and people having been aroused, the question was in
    debate as to whether the settlement should be allowed or
    not.</p>

    <p>At last a favourable change took place, the clouds
    dispersed, and the sky became clear. Oxen were sent to take the
    missionary waggons forward to Inyati, there to join
    Moselekatse. All was settled, a spot which looked well for a
    station was pointed out, each of the new-comers pitched his
    tent under a tree that he had chosen, until a more solid
    dwelling should be erected, and the Matabele Mission was fairly
    established. This was in December, 1859.</p>

    <p>The Mission was established, but work had only begun. The
    first six months of the year 1860 were months of incessant toil
    to the missionaries at Inyati. Houses had to be built, waggons
    repaired, and garden ground made ready for cultivation. Early
    and late, Moffat was to be found at work,&mdash;in the saw-pit,
    at the blacksmith's forge, or exercising his skill at the
    carpenter's bench; in all ways aiding and encouraging
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page129"
    id="page129"></a>{129}</span> his younger companions. He also
    endeavoured to gain Moselekatse's consent to the opening of
    regular communication with the Livingstone expedition on the
    Zambesi <i>vi</i> Matabeleland, but the suspicious nature of
    the monarch foiled this project. The isolation of his country
    in this direction was so great that, although but a
    comparatively short distance away, no tidings whatever could be
    obtained of the other party who, under Mr. Helmore, had gone to
    the Makololo tribe.</p>

    <p>In June, 1860, Moffat felt that his work at Inyati was done.
    He had spared neither labour of mind nor body in planting the
    Mission, and had endured hardships at his advanced age that
    younger men might well have shrunk from. The hour approached
    for him to bid a final farewell to Moselekatse, and once more
    he drew near to the chiefs kraal, with the purpose of speaking
    to him and his people, for the last time, on the all-important
    themes of life, death, and eternity. The old chief was in his
    large courtyard and received his missionary friend kindly.
    Together they sat, side by side&mdash;the Matabele despot,
    whose name struck terror even then into many native hearts, and
    the messenger of the Prince of Peace, the warriors ranged
    themselves in a semi-circle, the women crept as near as they
    could, and all listened to the last words of "Moshete." It was
    a solemn service, and closed the long series of efforts which
    the missionary had made to reach the hearts of Moselekatse and
    his people. On the morrow he started for home, which he reached
    in safety, having been absent twelve months.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, terrible trials had befallen the party who had
    started to found the Makololo Mission. The difficulties
    attending their journey to Linyanti were
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"
    id="page130"></a>{130}</span> such as nothing but the noblest
    Christian principle would have induced them to encounter, or
    enabled them to surmount. The chief of these was the great
    scarcity of water. One of their trials is thus
    described:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"From the Zouga we travelled on pretty comfortably, till
    near the end of November, when we suffered much from want of
    water.... For more than a week every drop we used had to be
    walked for about thirty-five miles. Mrs. Helmore's feelings may
    be imagined, when one afternoon, the thermometer standing at
    107 deg. in the shade, she was saving just <i>one spoonful of
    water</i> for each of the dear children for the next morning,
    not thinking of taking a drop herself. Mr. Helmore, with the
    men, was then away searching for water; and when he returned
    the next morning with the precious fluid, we found that he had
    walked <i>full forty miles</i>."</p>

    <p>At length, after enduring innumerable difficulties and
    privations for seven months, they arrived at Linyanti, the
    residence of the chief Sekeletu. He refused to allow them to
    remove to a more healthy spot, but proposed that they should
    live with him in the midst of his fever-generating marshes, and
    as no better plan offered, they were compelled to accept it. In
    the course of a week all were laid low with fever. Little Henry
    Helmore and his sister, with the infant babe of Mr. Price, were
    the first to die; then followed the heart-stricken mother, Mrs.
    Helmore; six weeks later Mr. Helmore breathed his last; and the
    missionary band was reduced to Mr. and Mrs. Price and the
    helpless orphans. As the only means of saving their lives the
    survivors prepared to depart, but now the chief threw obstacles
    in the way of their doing so. Their goods were stolen, their
    waggon taken possession <span class="pagenum"><a name="page131"
    id="page131"></a>{131}</span> of; and upon Mr. Price telling
    the chief that "if they did not let him go soon they would have
    to bury him beside the others," he was simply told "that he
    might as well die there as anywhere else."</p>

    <p>Finally a few things were allowed for the journey, and the
    sorrowful party started homeward, Mr. Price very ill, and his
    wife having lost the use of her feet and legs.</p>

    <p>With the scantiest possible provision they had to face a
    journey of upwards of a thousand miles to Kuruman, but they set
    forward. Just as they were beginning to take hope after their
    heavy trials, and to think of renewed efforts for the Lord,
    Mrs. Price was called to her rest. "My dear wife," wrote the
    sorrowing husband, "had been for a long time utterly helpless,
    but we all thought she was getting better. In the morning I
    found her breathing very hard. She went to sleep that night,
    alas! to wake no more. I spoke to her, and tried to wake her,
    but it was too late. I watched her all the morning. She became
    worse and worse, and a little after mid-day her spirit took its
    flight to God who gave it. I buried her the same evening under
    a tree&mdash;the only tree on the immense plain of Mahabe. This
    is indeed a heavy stroke, but 'God is my refuge and strength, a
    very present help in trouble.'"</p>

    <p>Finally the bereaved missionary was met by Mr. and Mrs.
    Mackenzie, who had started to join the Makololo Mission, and,
    as all turned their steps towards Kuruman, they were rejoiced
    by meeting Robert Moffat, who, having heard of the disaster,
    and that Mr. Price, with the remnant of the party, were on the
    road, had gone out in search of them. All returned sorrowfully
    to Kuruman, and the ill-fated Makololo Mission
    collapsed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"
    id="page132"></a>{132}</span></p>

    <p>Robert Moffat and his wife watched the progress of the
    Mission at Inyati with the keenest interest. In it they seemed
    to live their early life at Lattakoo over again. Their hearts
    were in the work of the missionaries at that distant station;
    and, over and above the earnest desire they had to see the work
    of God prosper among those uncivilised natives, was the tie of
    kinship, their own flesh and blood being present in the person
    of their son, John Moffat, who, with his wife, formed a portion
    of the Matabele Mission. Post-bags and supplies were forwarded
    by every available opportunity, and warm words of cheer and
    sympathy from the aged pair at Kuruman encouraged the workers
    in the far distant region to perseverance in their work for the
    Lord.</p>

    <p>Kuruman served indeed as a home station to which all the
    interior missionaries could look. The fact of being an interior
    missionary was sufficient to secure the travel-worn stranger,
    or friend, a warm welcome and good cheer for weeks together,
    and none entered more heartily or with deeper sympathy into the
    plans and endeavours of the wayfarer, or offered more earnest
    prayers on the behalf of himself and his work, than the tried
    and faithful couple, Robert and Mary Moffat, who had for so
    many years borne the burden and heat of the day.</p>

    <p>In October, 1861, their daughter Bessie, who was born on
    board ship in Table Bay, as they were leaving for their first
    visit to England, married Mr. R. Price, whose wife died the
    previous year, during that terrible journey from Linyanti, when
    the Makololo Mission had to be abandoned. Thus as one fell from
    the ranks, another stepped forward to take the vacant place,
    and carry on the glorious work for the sake of Him who said,
    "Go ye into all the world, and preach
    the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"
    id="page133"></a>{133}</span> Gospel to every creature." The
    Prices went for a time to Shoshong, hoping to join the Matabele
    Mission, but finally laboured among the Bakwena, under the
    chief Sechele.</p>

    <p>The Kuruman station itself during this time presented a
    scene of unabated activity. A revision of the New Testament was
    in progress, the youngest Miss Moffat, then the only child at
    home, was working hard at schools and classes, and Mr. Ashton
    was again at work with his old colleague.</p>

    <p>The year 1862 brought severe domestic bereavements to the
    Moffats. During a journey to Durban, in Natal, their eldest
    son, Mr. Robert Moffat, died, leaving a wife and four children.
    He had started to bring them from Durban to the home he had
    prepared at Kuruman. He had primarily been intended for a
    missionary, and had been sent to England to be educated for
    that purpose, but his health failing he had to return to South
    Africa, where for some time he served in the Survey Department
    under Government, and afterwards became a trader. He was very
    highly respected and had thoroughly gained the confidence of
    the natives.</p>

    <p>A few weeks later the sad tidings reached the sorrowing
    parents from the Zambesi that their eldest daughter Mary, the
    wife of Dr. Livingstone, had been called to her rest. A white
    marble cross, near Shupanga House on the Shir River, marks the
    spot where this sainted martyr to the cause of Africa's
    regeneration sleeps in peace.</p>

    <p>In the following year tidings reached Robert Moffat that
    William Ross the missionary at Lekatlong, about eighty miles to
    the south-east, was seriously ill. In a few hours Moffat was on
    his way; he arrived in time to find his friend alive, and did
    all that could be done <span class="pagenum"><a name="page134"
    id="page134"></a>{134}</span> to alleviate his suffering, but
    shortly after he also passed away. This mournful event led to
    Mr. Ashton being transferred to Lekatlong, and for a time the
    whole weight of duty at Kuruman rested on Moffat's
    shoulders.</p>

    <p>Although in perils oft, Robert Moffat had never suffered
    thus far personal violence from the hands of a native, but now
    he had a very narrow escape from death. A young man, who for
    some time had been living on the station, had shown signs of a
    disordered mind, and was placed under mild restraint.
    Conceiving a violent personal animosity against the missionary,
    he attacked him as he was returning from church, and with a
    knobbed stick inflicted some terrible blows, then, frightened
    at his own violence, he fled. To one with a weaker frame than
    Robert Moffat's the consequences might have been very serious;
    as it was he recovered, though with a heart that was sorely
    grieved.</p>

    <p>In 1865, the Mission was reinforced by the arrival of the
    Rev. John Brown, from England, and by John Moffat, who had
    returned from the Matabele. The relaxation from the active
    duties of the station thus afforded was utilised by Robert
    Moffat in the work of Scripture revision, the preparation of
    additional hymns, and the carrying of smaller works through the
    press.</p>

    <p>Mention has been made of the marriage of their second
    daughter, Ann, to Jean Frdoux, a missionary of the Paris
    Evangelical Society, who was stationed at Motito, a place
    situated about thirty-six miles to the north-east of Kuruman.
    He was a man of gentle disposition and addicted to study. Early
    in March, 1866, he had started upon a tour to carry on
    evangelistic work among the Barolong villages along the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page135"
    id="page135"></a>{135}</span> margin of the Kalahari desert.
    While visiting one of these, a low class trader arrived who had
    been guilty of atrocious conduct at Motito. The natives
    insisted upon the trader going to Kuruman, where his conduct
    could be investigated, and, upon his refusing to do so,
    prepared to take him by force. He intrenched himself in his
    waggon with all his guns loaded, and dared any one to lay hands
    upon him. Frdoux seeing the serious state that matters were
    assuming quietly drew near to the trader's waggon, and urged
    him to go peaceably to Kuruman, assuring him that the people
    were determined he should go, if not peaceably, then by
    force.</p>

    <p>While thus pleading with this man, a fearful explosion took
    place, the waggon and its occupant were blown to atoms, Jean
    Frdoux and twelve natives were killed, and about thirty more
    were injured.</p>

    <p>This was a further heavy affliction for Robert Moffat and
    his wife. As soon as they heard of the catastrophe, Robert
    hastened to succour his widowed daughter, and to consign to the
    grave at Motito the shattered remains of his son-in-law.</p>

    <p>A few months later another visit was paid to the open grave,
    this time to consign to its last resting place the body of Mrs.
    Brown, the wife of the Rev. John Brown, who a short time before
    had taken up his abode at the Kuruman as a colleague of Robert
    Moffat.</p>

    <p>In 1868 the missionary staff at that station consisted of
    Robert Moffat and his son John Moffat. The former had now more
    than completed the three-score years and ten allotted to man as
    the duration of human life, and unlike the great leader of
    God's chosen people, of whom it is said, "his eye was not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"
    id="page136"></a>{136}</span> dim, nor his natural force
    abated," Robert Moffat felt the infirmities of age creeping
    very rapidly upon him. Yet he held on his way for two years
    longer. A short and constant cough during the winter months
    aggravated his natural tendency to sleeplessness, and at last
    he felt himself reluctantly compelled to accept the invitation
    of the Directors to return finally to England.</p>

    <p>Going home to England it could hardly be called, his home
    was with his loved Bechwanas, with those for whom he had toiled
    and prayed so long. The ashes of his son Robert, and of his
    devoted daughter Mary reposed beneath the sands of Africa; his
    early and later manhood had been spent beneath its scorching
    sun. The house he was to leave had been the birthplace of most
    of his children, and his home for more than forty years. Yes,
    it was hard to leave; and the expectation had become very real
    to him that his body and that of his faithful partner would be
    laid side by side in that little burial-ground in the bushy
    dell, marked by a few trees, at Kuruman. But the final
    determination had been arrived at, and with slow and hesitating
    steps, as though waiting for something, even then, to prevent
    their departure, preparations were made for leaving the station
    for ever.</p>

    <p>Of the general aspect of affairs at the Kuruman during these
    last two years we have a graphic description from the pen of
    the Rev. John Moffat, who in a letter to the Directors dated
    12th October, 1868, wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"The public services on the station are a prayer-meeting at
    sunrise on Sunday; preaching in Sechwana, morning, afternoon,
    and evening, with the Sunday school twice, and a juvenile
    afternoon service. The early prayer-meeting is left entirely to
    the natives, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"
    id="page137"></a>{137}</span> three preaching services entirely
    to the missionaries, and the Sunday school, with the juvenile
    service, to my sister. There is also a Wednesday evening
    service, a monthly missionary prayer meeting, a church meeting,
    and a prayer meeting on Thursday afternoon. This last is in the
    hands of the natives. No native takes any part in the preaching
    on the station, except in extreme cases, when it is regarded as
    a makeshift. My father and I share the preaching between us.
    Occasionally, say once in three weeks, one of us rides to two
    villages to the north-west, holding services at each; they are
    respectively eight and twelve miles distant. My custom at home,
    in the regular way, is to give New Testament reading in the
    morning, a topical sermon in the afternoon, and Old Testament
    exposition in the evening. On Monday evening I have a young
    men's Bible class, which is to me the most interesting work I
    have to do, more especially as I have much encouragement in
    it.... On the Monday evening, also, my sister and I hold a
    practising class for the purpose of trying to improve the
    singing. On Tuesday evening I meet male inquirers, on
    Wednesday, before the service, I have a Bible class for women,
    on Thursday we have an English prayer meeting, and on Friday
    evening I meet female inquirers. I need not mention the school
    conducted by my sister and three native assistants."</p>

    <p>Speaking of the place and people he continues:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"The population is small and scattered. On the spot there
    must be a good many people, and also at the villages to the
    north-west; but otherwise the district contains only small
    villages of from twenty to one hundred huts. It extends fifty
    miles west and north-west, and about twenty-five miles in other
    directions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"
    id="page138"></a>{138}</span></p>

    <p>"The people are poor and must remain so. The country is
    essentially dry. Irrigation is necessary for successful
    agriculture, and there are few spots where water flows. There
    is no market for cattle, even if they throve abundantly, which
    they do not. I despair of much advance in civilisation, when
    their resources are so small, and when the European trade is on
    the principle of enormous profits and losses. Two hundred per
    cent, on Port Elizabeth prices is not considered out of the
    way.</p>

        <h4>MAIN STREET IN PORT ELIZABETH.</h4>
    </div>

    <p>"Heathenism, as a system, is weak, indeed in many places it
    is nowhere. Christianity meets with little opposition. The
    people generally are
    prodigious<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"
    id="page139"></a>{139}</span> Bible readers, church-goers, and
    psalm-singers, I fear to a large extent without knowledge.
    Religion to them consists in the above operations, and in
    giving a sum to the Auxiliary. I am speaking of the generality,
    There are many whom I cannot but feel to be Christians, but
    dimly. This can hardly be the result of low mental power alone.
    The Bechwanas show considerable acuteness when circumstances
    call it out.</p>

    <p>"The educational department of the Mission has been kept in
    the background. On this station the youth on leaving school
    have sunk back for want of a continued course being opened to
    them. The village schoolmasters, uneducated themselves, and
    mostly unpaid, make but a feeble impression. The wonder is that
    they do so much, and where the readers come from. It is hard to
    say that the older missionaries could have done otherwise.... I
    cannot tell you how one thing presses on me every day: the want
    of qualified native schoolmasters and teachers; and the
    question: how are they to be obtained?"</p>

    <p>On Sunday, 20th March, 1870, Robert Moffat preached for the
    last time in the Kuruman church, and on the Friday following
    the departure took place. "Ramary" and "Mamary," as Mr. and
    Mrs. Moffat were called, had completely won the hearts of the
    natives. For weeks past messages of farewell had been coming
    from the more distant towns and villages, and now that the
    final hour had arrived and the venerable missionary, with his
    long white beard, and his equally revered wife, left their
    house and walked to their waggon they were beset by crowds of
    people, each one longing for another shake of the hand, a last
    parting word, or a final look; and, as the waggon drove away, a
    long pitiful wail rose from those who
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page140"
    id="page140"></a>{140}</span> felt that their teacher and
    friend was with them no more.</p>

    <p>After a rough but safe journey of eight weeks, Robert and
    Mary Moffat reached Port Elizabeth on the 20th May, 1870, and
    received a hearty welcome from a large number of missionaries
    and other Christian friends, who had gathered to meet them.
    Making a brief stay they embarked in the mail steamer
    <i>Roman</i> and landed at Cape Town on the 2nd of June. Here
    they were entertained by the Christian community at a public
    breakfast. A few days later they embarked in the steamship
    <i>Norseman, en route</i> for England.</p>

    <h3>CLOSING SCENES.</h3>

    <p>In the Chronicle of the London Missionary Society for March,
    1870, the following notice appeared: "Our readers will be glad
    to hear that there is now a definite prospect of welcoming
    again to England our veteran missionary, the Rev. Robert
    Moffat. He may be expected, with Mrs. Moffat, about the month
    of June. Mr. Moffat no longer enjoys his former robust health.
    In his last letter he writes: 'What to me was formerly a
    molehill is now a mountain, and we both have for some time past
    begun to feel some of the labour and sorrow so frequently
    experienced by those who have passed their three-score years
    and ten.'"</p>

    <p>The <i>Norseman</i> reached Plymouth on the 24th of July,
    and next day Robert and Mary Moffat landed at Southampton, thus
    returning to their native land, to leave it no more, after an
    absence of over fifty years; during which time they had visited
    it only once before.</p>

    <p>On the 1st of August he was welcomed by the Society, at an
    influential meeting, convened for the purpose, in the Board
    Room of the Mission House,
    in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142"
    id="page142"></a>{142}</span> Blomfield Street. At that
    meeting, alluding to his previous visit in 1839, and to the
    printing of the New Testament in Sechwana, he stated as
    follows:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"When I came to the Cape, previous to my first visit, I
    brought a translation of the New Testament, which I had
    translated under considerable difficulties, being engaged a
    portion of the day in roofing an immense church, and the
    remainder in exegetical examinations and consulting
    concordances. I was anxious to get it printed, and I brought it
    down to the Cape, but there I could find no printing-office
    that would undertake it. The Committee of the Bible Society
    very kindly&mdash;as they have always been to me, I say it with
    pleasure&mdash;forwarded paper and ink to the Cape expecting I
    should get the work done there. As I said, there was not a
    printing-office that would undertake it. Dining with Sir George
    Napier, the Governor, I informed him of the difficulty. He
    said, 'Jump on board a ship with your translation and get it
    printed in England, and you will be back again while they are
    thinking about it here. Print a New Testament among a set of
    Dutch printers! why I can't even get my proclamations printed.'
    I said, 'I have become too barbarous; I have almost forgotten
    my own language; I should be frightened to go there.' 'Oh
    stuff!' he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143"
    id="page143"></a>{143}</span></p>

    <p>"Some time after he met me in the street: 'Well, Moffat,
    what have you determined upon?' 'I am waiting the return of Dr.
    Philip.' 'Don't wait for anybody; just jump on board a ship.
    Think of the importance of getting the New Testament put in
    print in a new language!' He invited me to dinner again and
    said, 'Have you come to a conclusion? I wish I could give you
    mine. I feel some interest in the extension of the knowledge of
    the Word of God. Take nobody's advice, but jump on board a ship
    for England.' He spoke so seriously that I began to feel
    serious myself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144"
    id="page144"></a>{144}</span></p>

    <div class="center">
        <img src="images/0195.jpg" alt="MARY MOFFAT"
        title="MARY MOFFAT" width="550" />

        <h4>MARY MOFFAT.</h4>
    </div>

    <p>"Dr. Philip came, and when the Governor explained the
    circumstances, the Doctor said, 'Go, by all means.' I was
    nervous at the thought. I was not a nervous man in Africa. I
    could sleep and hear the lions roar. There seemed so many great
    folks to meet with. I came to England and by-and-by I got over
    it."</p>

    <p>On the Wednesday, following this meeting, he was entertained
    at a public breakfast at the Cannon Street Hotel.</p>

    <p>For a few weeks the Moffats dwelt at Canonbury, though
    Robert himself was so much engaged in visiting different parts
    of the country, Edinburgh included, where he met with many old
    friends, that he was not suffered at this time to dwell for
    long in any one place.</p>

    <p>The winter was spent at Brixton, and on the 21st of
    December, 1000 was presented to Robert Moffat as a birthday
    gift, a most cheering tribute of esteem to a tried and faithful
    servant of Jesus Christ.</p>

    <p>The effects of this act of kindness had not passed away when
    a heavy cloud hung over the happy home at Brixton. She, who for
    more than half-a-century had been the loving helpmeet of the
    African missionary, sharing his joys and sorrows, his hopes and
    discouragements, and many of his privations and perils, lay
    dying. A troublesome cough, a difficulty of breathing, a few
    long deep breaths, and she was gone, without even a word of
    farewell; called home to receive the "Well done, good and
    faithful servant," and to enter into the joy of her Lord. Her
    last words were a prayer for her husband, that strength might
    be given him to bear the
    blow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145"
    id="page145"></a>{145}</span></p>

    <p>Robert Moffat indeed needed strength in this hour of
    affliction. His first exclamation on finding that she had
    really gone was, "For fifty-three years I have had her to pray
    for me," and writing to his old friend and fellow-labourer,
    Roger Edwards, who was then at Port Elizabeth, he said, "How
    lonely I feel, and if it were not for Jeanie (his daughter) it
    would be much more so."</p>

    <p>The events of the next few years may be briefly summarised.
    He travelled much to different parts of the country, visiting
    High Leigh, the old house at Dukinfield, and Carronshore. His
    services were continually in requisition for missionary
    meetings, and doubtless many of our readers will be old enough
    to remember the bronzed face, with its full flowing beard,
    blanched by age, the keen eyes, and the venerable form of
    Robert Moffat at this time, and to call to mind the pleasure
    they derived as they listened to his glowing descriptions of
    the needs of Africa.</p>

    <p>The winter of 1871 was passed at Ventnor, in the Isle of
    Wight, and occupied in revising proof sheets of the Old
    Testament in Sechwana. While there he was, by Her Majesty's own
    desire, introduced to the Queen, whom he had never seen before.
    He also received the degree of Doctor of Divinity, from the
    University of Edinburgh.</p>

    <p>To meet the need for training a native ministry, which had
    been felt by Moffat and others engaged in the work of the
    Bechwana Mission, and which had shortly before his return been
    pressed upon the attention of the Directors, several thousand
    pounds were subscribed, and, as a way of doing honour to the
    veteran who was now in their midst, it was proposed to call the
    Institute that was to be founded, "The Moffat Institute." This
    now stands as a centre of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page146"
    id="page146"></a>{146}</span> influence amidst the tribes
    surrounding the Kuruman station.</p>

    <p>In 1873, a number of friends, who thought that the liberal
    contributions which had been subscribed to the Institute,
    hardly gave such a direct proof of their esteem for their
    venerated friend as could be desired, presented Robert Moffat
    with a sum of upwards of 5000. This liberality provided for
    his wants during the remainder of his life, enabled him to
    serve the Directors and the cause of missions, without being
    any longer a burden upon the funds of the Society, and also
    placed him in a position to meet the wants of his widowed
    daughter and her fatherless family.</p>

    <p>While living at Brixton, Robert Moffat attended the ministry
    of the late Rev. Baldwin Brown, in whose mission-work in
    Lambeth he was much interested. On his eightieth birthday, 21st
    December, 1875, he opened the new Mission Hall in connection
    with this work, which hall was thenceforward called by his
    name. On the same day he received many congratulatory tokens,
    among them being an address signed by a great number of
    Congregational ministers from every part of the country. Prior
    to this in the same year, he had lectured upon Missions in
    Westminster Abbey, and in the preceding year he had performed
    the melancholy duty of identifying the remains of his
    son-in-law, Dr. Livingstone, upon their being brought home from
    Africa.</p>

    <p>Engagements and constant requests for his services made
    great inroads upon his time. "People either could not or would
    not see that he was getting old," he frequently said; but
    people knew that as long as he had strength to speak, he would
    not grow weary of addressing audiences on missionary work.</p>

    <p>In 1876, we find him dining on one occasion with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"
    id="page147"></a>{147}</span> the Archbishop of Canterbury at
    Lambeth Palace, and on another breakfasting with Mr. Gladstone,
    in the house of the Rev. Newman Hall. In the following year by
    invitation of the French Missionary Society he visited Paris,
    and while there addressed a meeting of 4000 Sunday-school
    children.</p>

    <p>On the 20th of December, 1878, he received the freedom of
    the City of London, and somewhat over two years later was the
    guest of the then Lord Mayor, Alderman, now Sir William,
    McArthur, for several days, a banquet being given in his
    honour.</p>

    <p>During the time that Cetewayo was in England Robert Moffat
    was much interested in him and paid him a visit. Among the Zulu
    king's attendants was a man who could speak Sechwana, and with
    him Moffat at once got into conversation. The man's delight was
    unbounded. He had been in the train of a son of Moselekatse,
    and had heard of the missionary. "A u Moshete?" (Are you
    Moffat) he asked again and again, with beaming eyes exclaiming
    when convinced of the fact, "I see this day what my eyes never
    expected to behold, Moshete!"</p>

    <p>For the last four years of his life Robert Moffat resided at
    Park Cottage, Leigh, near Tunbridge, where he was the tenant of
    the late Samuel Morley, Esq. From both Mr. and Mrs. Morley he
    received much kindness, which continued until the day of his
    death.</p>

    <p>The end now drew near. In 1883, he complained of great
    weariness and intermittent pulsation. This troubled him so
    constantly that advice was sought. For a short time this
    availed. He attended the Bible Society's meeting in the second
    week in May, and the meeting of the London Missionary Society
    on the 10th, and in July paid a visit to Knockholt, where he
    met Mr. and Mrs. George Sturge. From this visit he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page148"
    id="page148"></a>{148}</span> returned seeming better, but in a
    few days unfavourable symptoms again showed themselves. Yet the
    strong frame, that had endured so much, seemed loath to give
    in, and, whenever able, he was in and out of his garden. He
    also took two drives, Mrs. Morley very kindly sending her
    carriage for that purpose when he felt able to make use of
    it.</p>

    <p>"Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end
    of that man is peace." Most beautifully was this truth
    exemplified in the closing scenes of the life of this truly
    noble and good man. On Sunday, 5th August, he was too weak to
    attend chapel, and spent a peaceful Sabbath at home. He was
    very fond of hymns and would often repeat one after another. In
    the evening he chose several which were sung, though feebleness
    prevented him from joining the singing. Among those chosen
    were: "The sands of time are sinking," "Come, Thou fount of
    every blessing," "How sweet the name of Jesus sounds," and
    "Nearer, my God, to Thee." His New Testament was his constant
    companion during these last days, and whatever the topic of
    conversation, it always turned with him to heaven and the
    Saviour.</p>

    <p>On Monday he seemed somewhat better, but on Tuesday night he
    was much worse. Hours of pain and sleeplessness were passed,
    yet he rose on Wednesday and went out several times to the
    garden. In the evening he became very ill and had a fainting
    fit, but managed after awhile to get upstairs, and, after
    remaining on the bedside for some time, propped up with
    pillows, he undressed, with little assistance and much
    deliberation, winding up his watch, with a cold, trembling
    hand,&mdash;"for the last time," he said.</p>

    <p>The doctor arrived shortly afterwards, who found
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page149"
    id="page149"></a>{149}</span> that he had broken a
    blood-vessel. The night was passed partly in peaceful sleep,
    and partly in converse with his children who were then present.
    His daughter says, "He was just full of his Saviour's love and
    mercy all through his life; he repeated many hymns and passages
    of Scripture."</p>

    <p>On Thursday morning he was visited by Mr. Morley and two
    other friends, with whom he conversed. He also had his
    Testament, but finding he could not read it, his daughters read
    to him. He repeated many hymns, among them the Scotch version
    of the hundred and third Psalm, but stopped and said, "There is
    nothing like the original," which was then read from the Bible.
    His mother's favourite hymn, "Hail, sovereign Light," was also
    by his special desire read to him.</p>

    <p>Another sleep&mdash;a wandering, perhaps unconscious, look
    at his children, a struggle, and then a quietness? and the
    pilgrimage was over, the spirit had fled to be present with the
    Lord whom he had loved so well and served so faithfully. "His
    end was peace."</p>

    <p>He died on the 10th of August, 1883, in his eighty-eighth
    year.</p>

    <p>The funeral took place a few days later at Norwood Cemetery,
    when, surrounded by such relatives as were in England, Sir
    Bartle Frere, Mr. Samuel Morley and several other Members of
    Parliament, deputations from the various Missionary and several
    Religious Societies, and by the Mayor of Bloemfontein, his
    remains were consigned to the tomb.</p>

    <h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

    <p>As soon as it was realised that Robert Moffat had actually
    gone, it was felt that a truly great man had departed from
    among us. A niche in the temple of earth's true nobility seemed
    empty. The prevailing feeling was given expression to by some
    of the leading journals, which in eulogistic articles commented
    upon the life, work, and character of him who had gone.</p>

    <p><i>The Times</i>, in its review, contained the following
    remarks:&mdash;"His chief work was among the Bechwanas. His
    picture of what they were when he first knew them would hardly
    now be recognised, so entirely have they changed under the new
    influences which Moffat was the first to bring to bear upon
    them. He found them mere savages, constantly at war among
    themselves and with their neighbours, ignorant of the arts of
    agriculture, and in the utterly degraded state for which we
    must seek a counterpart now in the more distant tribes, whom
    the message of civilisation has not yet reached. His first care
    was to make himself thoroughly master of the language of those
    to whom he was sent. For fifty years he has declared he had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page151"
    id="page151"></a>{151}</span> been accustomed to speak the
    Bechwana tongue; he reduced it to written characters, and
    translated the Scriptures into it. The Bechwanas, under
    Moffat's guidance, became new men. Mission work grew and spread
    among them; what Moffat had begun to do was taken up by other
    hands; a permanent body of native pastors was created from
    among the Bechwanas themselves, and the whole region was raised
    out of the savage state in which Moffat had found it, and
    became, in no small degree, civilised as well as
    Christianised.... It would seem, indeed, that it is only by the
    agency of such men as Moffat and his like that the contact of
    the white and black races can be anything but a curse to the
    blacks. It is the missionary alone who seeks nothing for
    himself. He has chosen an unselfish life. If honour comes to
    him, it is by no choice of his own, but as the unsought tribute
    which others, as it were, force upon him. Robert Moffat has
    died in the fullness both of years and honours. His work has
    been to lay the foundations of the Church in the central
    regions of South Africa. As far as his influence and that of
    his coadjutors and successors has extended, it has brought with
    it unmixed good. His name will be remembered while the South
    African Church endures, and his example will remain with us as
    a stimulus to others, and as an abiding proof of what a
    Christian missionary can be and can do."</p>

    <p>The <i>Brighton Daily News</i> commenced its article by
    saying:&mdash;"The grave has just closed over one of the most
    notable men whose figures are familiar to the inhabitants of
    Brighton. Robert Moffat, the veteran pioneer in the mission
    field, and the simplest of heroes, has passed away, and many of
    the noblest of the land followed his remains to their
    resting-place."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152"
    id="page152"></a>{152}</span> It concluded with, "In the
    drawing-rooms of fashionable Brighton, crowded with the lovers
    of art and science, no one grudged the cessation of music the
    most classical, or of conversation the most charming, to listen
    to the venerable Doctor when requested to repeat some incidents
    of his missionary life. All felt that the scene was hallowed by
    the presence of one who had done a work for the good of men,
    such as few have been privileged to accomplish. Robert Moffat
    belonged to no sect or party. To better the world and advance
    the one Church formed the sole end of his being."</p>

    <p>Other journals and magazines bore like testimony to his
    worth.</p>

    <p>Of his work we have said much in the preceding pages, and
    also something of its results. To this may be added Robert
    Moffat's own account of some of the benefits which sprung from
    the prosecution of missionary enterprise in South Africa. In
    his speech at Port Elizabeth, on finally leaving for England,
    in May, 1870, referring to the general progress made in the
    interior, he said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Christianity has already accomplished much in this long
    benighted land. When I first went to the Kuruman scarcely an
    individual could go beyond. Now they travel in safety to the
    Zambesi. Then we were strangers, and they could not comprehend
    us. They treated us with great indignity, and considered us to
    be the outcasts of society, who, being driven from our own
    race, went to reside with them; but bearing in remembrance what
    our Saviour had to undergo, we were encouraged to persevere,
    and much success has rewarded our efforts. Now it is safe to
    traverse any part of the country, and traders travel far beyond
    Kuruman without the slightest fear of
    molesta<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"
    id="page153"></a>{153}</span> tion. Formerly men of one tribe
    could not travel through another's territory, and wars were
    frequent. During my early mission life, I often heard of men of
    one tribe going to trade with another, and being murdered. I
    was at a native place when a thing of that sort once occurred.
    A party of men had come two hundred miles to dispose of some
    articles. The resident natives, taking a dislike to them, set
    upon them and killed two of their number. I asked them why they
    had done this, and tried to show them it was wrong. They seemed
    to know that; and from that time I have never heard of anything
    of the sort.</p>

    <p>"The influence of Christianity in that country is now very
    great, and constantly increasing. Where one station was
    scarcely tolerated, there are now several. The Moravians have
    their missionaries. The Berlin Society have theirs, and others
    are engaged in the good work, besides numerous native Gospel
    teachers. Our advanced station at the Matabele is in a very
    prosperous state, and I quite expect that the Matabele will
    become one day a great nation. They sternly obey their own
    laws, and I have noticed that when men of fixed principles
    become convinced of the great truths of Christianity they hold
    firmly to the faith, and their fidelity is not lightly to be
    shaken."</p>

    <p>In the same speech he also mentioned the fact that whereas
    at first the natives would not buy anything, not even a pocket
    handkerchief, now, when he was speaking, no less than sixty
    thousand pounds worth of British manufactures passed yearly
    into the hands of the native tribes around Kuruman.</p>

    <p>Thus the missionary prepared the way for the merchant, and
    the Gospel for the progress of civilisation.</p>

    <p>Of Moffat's character we have had frequent glimpses in the
    preceding pages; of his personal appearance
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page154"
    id="page154"></a>{154}</span> and dignified mien our portrait
    and pictures give some idea. A few words may, however, be
    added, based upon the facts recorded by his son in the last
    chapter of "Robert and Mary Moffat."</p>

    <p>Tall and strong, with dark piercing eyes, he stood, a man of
    dauntless courage, quick and energetic in action, with a
    resolution in the performance of duty that no opposition could
    thwart; yet, withal, of gentle manner, and of an even temper,
    proof against the many attacks made upon it. His disposition
    was to think well of men, and to believe what they said. Deceit
    he hated, it was the one thing he could not forgive. He trusted
    men implicitly; and this probably accounted for the fact that
    the Bechwanas, who carried the art of lying to perfection,
    seldom lied to him. They knew it was the one thing that would
    make him angry.</p>

    <p>His reverence for holy things was very great. He relished a
    joke as well as any man, indeed, there was a good deal of
    humour in him; but woe to that man who spoke jestingly of the
    things pertaining to God. The Word of the Lord was too real and
    too important for any triviality. God was ever present to him,
    and he lived for God. His son says: "Even when I was alone with
    him, on some of his itinerating journeys, no meal was commenced
    without a reverent doffing of the Scotch bonnet, his usual
    head-dress in those days, and the solemn blessing; and our
    morning and evening worship was never missed or hurried."</p>

    <p>An instance of his forbearance under provocation is afforded
    in the following:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"On our return from England in 1843," says the writer just
    quoted, "we were a large party, with three or four waggons. One
    night we outspanned in the dark, not knowing that we were on
    forbidden ground&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155"
    id="page155"></a>{155}</span> within the limits of a farm, but
    a half-mile short of the homestead. In the early morning a
    young man rode up, and demanded to know what we were doing
    there without leave. My father gently explained that we had
    done it in ignorance, but his explanation was cut short by a
    harangue loud and long. The stripling sat on his horse, my
    father stood before him with bowed head and folded arms, whilst
    a torrent of abuse poured over him, with a plentiful mixture of
    such terse and biting missiles of invective as greatly enrich
    the South African Dutch language. We stood around and
    remembered that only a few months before the man thus rated
    like a dog was standing before enthusiastic thousands in
    England, who hung with bated breath upon his utterances.
    Something of shame must have arrested the wrath of the young
    man, for he suddenly rode away without impounding our cattle,
    as he had threatened to do. We inspanned and proceeded, calling
    on our way at the house, and there we found ourselves received
    by a venerable white-haired farmer and his wife with open arms,
    for they and my parents proved to be old friends. Right glad
    were we that nothing had been done on our side to make us
    ashamed to meet them."</p>

    <p>In his home he was a true father, and the influence that
    surrounded his children must have been a happy one, seeing that
    so many of them embraced the missionary calling, and followed
    in the footsteps of their venerated parents. Mary, the eldest
    daughter, married Dr. Livingstone; Ann, the French missionary,
    Jean Frdoux; Bessie, a younger daughter, was united to the
    Rev. Roger Price; and a son, the Rev. John Moffat, became for a
    time his father's coadjutor at the Kuruman station.</p>

    <p>In bringing this memoir to a conclusion, we may
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page156"
    id="page156"></a>{156}</span> be permitted to glance at South
    Africa as it is at the present time, and to note some of the
    contrasts between its condition now, and that as stated in our
    opening chapter, prior to Robert Moffat's arrival.</p>

    <p>At the time when he first landed at Cape Town, the work of
    evangelising the heathen was confined principally to two
    Societies&mdash;the Moravian Mission and the London Missionary
    Society. Now the Societies exceed twelve in number, and
    represent the following nationalities: English, American,
    French, Swiss, Norwegian, and the people of Finland.</p>

    <p>First, in order of date, may be noticed the work of the
    Moravian Brethren, which is chiefly carried on among the
    Hottentots and Kafirs. Their chief station is Genadendal,
    eighty miles east of Cape Town, which has several smaller
    stations grouped around it. Besides these, still farther east,
    among the Kafir tribes, is the station of Shiloh, also having a
    number of out-stations gathered round it.</p>

    <p>The London Missionary Society follows with its eleven
    principal stations and nine out-stations. This Society is now
    labouring in South Africa, in Kafirland, Bechwanaland and
    Matabeleland. The Report for 1886 shows sixteen English
    missionaries and sixty-five native preachers as engaged in
    preaching and teaching, and as results, 1361 Church members.
    These returns are however incomplete, and very much has
    occurred, through the numerous wars and unsettled state of the
    country, to retard the progress of missionary work.</p>

    <p>Next comes the Wesleyan Missionary Society, who, commencing
    operations at Cape Town in 1814, extended their stations round
    the coast from Little Namaqualand to Zululand. They are also
    labouring among the Barolongs in the Orange Free State,
    in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157"
    id="page157"></a>{157}</span> Swaziland, and at the Gold Fields
    at Barberton, in the Transvaal.</p>

    <p>The Scotch Presbyterians are represented by the missions of
    the Free Church of Scotland, and the United Presbyterian
    Church. These confine their labours principally to British
    Kaffraria and Kafirland. The Free Church has a high-class
    Institution at Lovedale for the training of a native ministry
    and also for teaching the natives many of the useful arts, and
    an improved system of agriculture. There is an efficient staff
    of teachers, and in 1885, 380 pupils attended the Institution,
    of whom seventy-one were Church members and ninety-one
    candidates or inquirers. A similar institution has also been
    established among the Fingoes at Blythswood in Fingoland.</p>

    <p>More than fifty years ago, at the suggestion of Dr. Philip,
    the Rhenish Mission commenced work among the Hottentots of Cape
    Colony, but its operations extended, and now embrace Little and
    Great Namaqualand, south and north of the Orange River, and,
    away beyond, the territory known as Damaraland. Their stations
    are in a flourishing condition, and some 15,000 converts bear
    evidence to the success of their efforts. This Society also
    looks after the preparation of native teachers, &amp;c., and
    has an excellent institution for that purpose at Worcester,
    near Cape Town, its principal station.</p>

    <p>Still farther north, beyond Damaraland is Ovampoland,
    occupied by the Missionary Society of Finland. Seven ordained
    Missionaries and three Christian artisans were equipped and
    despatched to work in this region, at the suggestion of the
    Rhenish Society. Their enterprise is of comparatively recent
    date and results cannot yet be tabulated. The influence for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page158"
    id="page158"></a>{158}</span> good exerted will, however,
    doubtless yield fruit by-and-by.</p>

    <p>The missions of the Berlin Society stretch from the eastern
    portion of Cape Colony to the Transvaal, and embrace also the
    Orange Free State and the Diamond Fields. They have over 7000
    converts, and a large number of children under instruction in
    various schools.</p>

    <p>Basutoland, to the east of the Orange Free State, is cared
    for by the French Evangelical Missionary Society, who commenced
    work in South Africa in 1829. Their first missionaries were
    appointed to the Bahurutse, then tributary to Moselekatse, but
    being repulsed through the jealousy of that potentate they
    settled at Motito, and finally accepted an invitation from
    Moshesh, chief of the Basutos, to work among that people. The
    mission has fourteen principal stations and sixty-six
    out-stations, with about 20,000 adherents, of whom about 3500
    are Church members.</p>

    <p>In 1835 six missionaries, appointed by the American Board of
    Foreign Missions, arrived from the United States to labour in
    South Africa. Three proceeded to Natal and settled near Durban.
    The other three journeyed to Moselekatse at Mosega. Their
    mission was however broken up through the incursions of the
    Boers, and they were compelled to flee to Natal. For some years
    the mission there was much harassed through war, but it is now
    firmly established and is doing excellent work of a religious
    and educational character, having a number of well-instructed
    native pastors and teachers, besides the staff of European
    missionaries. In 1886 the Board reports having in connection
    with this mission seven stations and seventeen out-stations,
    and 886 Church members.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159"
    id="page159"></a>{159}</span></p>

    <p>The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel commenced its
    missions in South Africa in 1838. Its work is divided between
    the Colonists and the natives, and is carried on in Cape Colony
    and Natal; its dioceses stretching round the coast much in the
    same manner as the Wesleyan stations.</p>

    <p>Besides those already mentioned, there are at work now in
    South Africa the Norwegian Missionary Society, labouring in
    Natal and Zululand; the Hermannsburg Mission, founded by Pastor
    Harms, whose operations are carried on in Natal, Zululand, and
    the Transvaal; and the Swiss society, The Mission of the Free
    Church of the Canton de Vaud, whose efforts are directed to a
    tribe inhabiting a country between Delagoa Bay and
    Sofala.<a name="FNanchor_A_2"
    id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2"
    class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

    <div class="footnote">
        <p><a name="Footnote_A_2"
        id="Footnote_A_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_2"><span class="label">
        [A]</span></a> Many of the facts contained in this review
        of Mission work in South Africa have been gleaned from
        "South Africa," by the Rev. James Sibree, F.R.G.S.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Thus the missionary cause has grown, notwithstanding the
    many difficulties it has had to contend with, and now the sound
    of the Gospel is heard throughout the land. From the
    southernmost part of what was the "Dark Continent," but which
    is now termed by some the "Twilight Continent," and which we
    trust may soon be blessed with the full light of Christianity,
    there stretches away a series of mission stations right to the
    Zambesi; and there joining hands with the system of Central
    African missions the glad tidings of salvation are wafted
    onward to the great lake, the Victoria Nyanza, in the north;
    eastward to the coast; and, in the west, made known to
    thousands by means of the various organisations now doing such
    excellent work on the Congo River.</p>

    <p>In a central position, amidst the tribes of South Africa,
    Kuruman, the scene of Robert Moffat's trials
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page160"
    id="page160"></a>{160}</span> and triumphs, stands to-day,
    surrounded by a number of native towns and villages, where
    native teachers, trained in the Moffat Institute, are located,
    and native Churches have been formed,&mdash;a beacon shedding
    its glorious rays around, dispelling the darkness, and bringing
    the heathen to the knowledge of the Saviour, Jesus
    Christ.</p><br />

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
